                "review": "Cyberpunk 2077 is, perhaps, one of the best single-player games of all time. After it's disastrous launch in 2020, it have come a long way with updates and fixes, and now with a complete new DLC. There is no game that comes close to it's setting, stories, side quests, gameplay, world, characters; you can without any problem play for more than 80 hours without losing the fun, and there is lots of replay value once you know the consequences of your choices, what the best builds are, and what decisions are the best. Sadly, I do not think it comes close to GTA V in personalization; there are not a lot of apartments/houses to buy, you can't customize cars, customizing your character is limited (albeit this can be improved by easy to install MODS) and world and NPCs interactions are scarce. But this is not a problem when you understand that the game focus is it's stories, the main stories and side stories. There is such a variety in stories, no story is like other. You may have a laugh in one, and in other you may be left sad, when you see the world's real problems. Highly recommend this game for anyone who enjoys captivating stories and good gameplay.",

                "review": "60 hours in and I have a lot of thoughts about the game. First things first the performance is still leaving a lot to be desired. To have any hope of getting over 60 fps on this game you have to utilize either DLSS or FSR technology unless you are rich enough to have a 4090. \n\nPut about 30 hours into the games when it first came out and many of the most major bugs and crash problems have been fixed. I still found the game not quite as polished as I would like it to be as a final product but it is certainly in a much better state than it was. I encountered several issues where quests became bugged, and there is lots and lots of buggy AI. For a game that came out recently this game really should have much better AI. I also experienced many visual and texture bugs especially when having ray tracing enabled. Characters skin would often appear very shiny or metallic in appearance and it really ruins the atmosphere especially in emotional cut scenes. I also encountered an issue where often times after closing the pause menu or inventory menu the game would be become blindingly bright for a couple of seconds. I'm guessing this issue has something to do with how the dynamic lighting system works but I'm not an expert on it. I only experienced one crash in 60 hours of game time so far which is acceptable for a game as performance heavy as this.\n\nApart from the visual glitches and other minor bugs the game runs pretty well. The world building and storytelling in this game is second to none. This likely due to the already lore filled and interesting universe created by Mike Pondsmith. The world feels alive and it really makes you feel like you are living as a merc in one of the shittiest places possible. I do have problems with how linear the main story line feels, especially compared to previous CD Projekt titles like the witcher. I also wish there was more customization options for your character, especially in terms of cyberware  and body modifications.\n\nDespite all of the problems I have with this game, the universe and world building it establishes is so interesting and engaging and keeps me coming back to this game. This game has also been a good gateway into some of the deeper cyberpunk lore of the Pondsmith universe, and I hope they take more creative tips from him when it comes to the sequel. Overall despite the issues, CP2077 manages to stand on its own as one of the greats of all time when it comes to open world rpg's.\n\nOne side note, I was really dissapointed that the performance of the Phantom Liberty dogtown area was even worse than the original areas of Night City. Despite that, the overall quality of the storyline and side quests in the DLC consistently delivers as a great high quality experience.\n\nBefore 2.0: 5/10 After 2.0 and Phantom Liberty: 8.75/10",

The world looks amazing and theres a bunch of tiny little details that make the world feel super immersive. Game mechanics are super easy to pick up, and all and all, the game is a blast.

                "review": "I guess it's time for my review after so much time. I started with 1.5 when the game was already better than its launch. The game is now 2.02 as of this review.\n\nIn short: Recommended now.\n\nI think that it is important to note that players used to 1.x had to learn the RPG stats/perks aspect all over again with 2.x. That includes myself. 2.02 works for what it is. If this'll be your first outing into Night City, it shouldn't be too much of an issue after passing the initial decision paralysis.\n\nNow, the particulars:\n[i]Graphics:[/i] Very nice on maximum.\nFirst-person PC casts no reflection. FPP does cast a full shadow. There is no native 3rd person option. It's leaning toward realism but not ultrarealistic. Less-than-maximum setting is still a decent experience. Low setting is just okay.\n\n[i]Gameplay:[/i] Nice.\nAs one should expect, it doesn't capture the pre-rendered teaser trailer from way back when the game was first announced. Stealth is an option, but it's difficult in its own way just as guns blazing has its own difficulties. (Prior to 2.x, stealth was easy.)\n\n[i]Audio:[/i] Nice.\nVideo game quality, not ultrarealistic.\n\n[i]Audience:[/i] Kids'll want it for the taboo factor. (That's pretty much all the M/18 rating does these days—make kids want to play it.) Adults will probably enjoy the story and related gameplay regardless of the M/18 content.\n\n[i]PC requirements:[/i] For max settings, a hefty PC.\nFor a decent experience, mid-high end. Anything mid-range or lower will probably have trouble with performance even on low settings. Keep your PC clean. Hidden bloatware included in Windows and so many hardware utilities will wreck performance. The same goes for simple applications, especially \"free\" and low-cost apps. This is general advice and not just for Cyberpunk 2077.\n\n[i]Difficulty:[/i] YMMV.\nThis game could be easy or difficult depending on which genres you're proficient. There is a difficulty slider that'll either tweak it too much or not enough... again based on your expertise in specific genres of games. Cyberpunk 2077 allows for a few different gameplay styles, each to be considered as their own subgenre.\n\n[i]Grind:[/i] No.\nIt offers optional grinds for completionists. 2.x now scales up from a minimum level by location, but that minimum level is set to what one could expect when running only through the main story arcs. You won't need to grind for playing just the primary stories, but you also won't become overpowered by doing all the side quests and events or taking initiative on hostiles found around Night City and surrounding area.\n\n[i]Story:[/i] Decent.\nIf you know [i]nothing[/i] about the story (like it was for me), it'll be very good. If you already know the story, it'll still be okay to experience yourself but nothing exceptional.\n\n[i]Game time:[/i] Running through to an ending will take up some time, but it'll be like a week of playtime for the employed person.\nExploring options on ways to complete the game will add a lot of time. Completionists will take much, much longer. There is a lot of bits and bobs around the game. Some have their own little stories, but must are just idle work.\n\n[i]Price:[/i] For both Cyberpunk 2077 and its optional Phantom Liberty expansion, I'd wait for a sale.\nIt's good, but that's still a nice chunk of change for a game that's been out for a long time, even with all the improvements since its uncertain launch.\n\n[i]Bugs:[/i] Not many.\nWhat games of this scope doesn't have them these days? Showstoppers? I haven't run into any even way back in 1.5. 2.x hasn't introduced any for me. Annoying? For me, more like funny, but I will admit that I often find humor in more things than many others.\n\n[i]Summary:[/i] 8/10?\nFor me, I feel like 7.75/10. A modded game can bring it up to 9/10. So, 8/10.\n\n[i]Replayability:[/i] Sure.\nIt can end in different ways, and some choices during the course of the game affect things later. If you know all the endings already, it has less replayability excepting to see how minor choices affect the non-critical stories.\n\n[b][u]Extras:[/u][/b]\nIf you're here just for run-and-gun, there will be a lot of interruptions in that and fewer opportunities than one might think.\n\nCyberpunk was inspired by a table-top RPG. If you came here from Cyberpunk RED (TTRPG):[list][*]The combat has been converted into video game standards with chance being left to hacking and with gunplay and melee moved to player skill, all improved with perks from levelling.\n[*]Careers don't exist for the player character. The game has three \"life paths\" that only affect the tutorial mission and occasional dialog options.\n[*]Cyberpsychosis is not possible for the player due to how the game limits the use of Chrome on the player. The Cyberpsychosis mechanic from the tabletop game for becoming a Cyberpsycho is not implemented in the game at all. Either an NPC is a Cyberpsycho or isn't.\n[*]You do not gain or lose faction status. This includes gangs, military, and corporations. You can gain and lose favorability with [i]specific[/i] characters in factions based on actions and dialogs. These decisions can appear later in the stories.[/list]\n[b]It shouldn't need to be stated that an M/18 game will have a lot of sensitive content[/b], but just to be sure:\nIf you're an explorer in games, you'll encounter topics that include violence (duh), self-harm, drugs, alcohol, sex, non-consensual sex (because Steam doesn't allow the word), physical abuse, emotional abuse, genderism, stereotypes, child abuse, bigotry, mental health, classism, poverty, infidelity, privilege, politics, religion, persecution, and more.\n\nIf you want escapism from IRL social drama, you will not find it here. All you will find is escapism from today's ordinary life into a hero's life in a future where Humanity is still the same ole' flawed Humanity but with even more dangerous toys to play with.",

At that time, this game was not worth the buy with all its issues. I bought the game when 1.2 came out because, although it had its issues, I still really loved the world and the car design in it.\n\nAs patches have came out for this game it has only gotten better and better and better. With the updates to stability and performance coinciding with additional content being added into the game, it has only gone from strength to strength. Now with the 2.0 patch and Phantom Liberty, this game has become an absolute masterpiece for CDPR and, in my opinion, their greatest piece of work to date. For me, this is my favourite game of all time. I cannot express how much I love this game, this world, these characters. It gives me such a feeling of happiness to be my character, having her look exactly how I want her to and go be a hommicidal, car loving lesbian in one of the most stunning city based game worlds I have ever seen brings me such a sense of joy that no game has really done for me.\n\nI love this game to death and I am so glad I bought it back then and stuck with it. Thank you CDPR for sticking with it too and making this game the masterpiece it always could have been",

U can always experience the left out content in your second playthrough or loading up a saved file from the past.Everything about this game amazes me especially how beautiful the night city is,the combat,the weapon variety and designs ,the progression system,how u can literally turn yourself into a living terminator with help of cyberwares ....everything is perfect.This is a must play\n\n9/10",

                "review": "Now that the game is almost completely fixed up (I had quite a few crashes still, but never lost more than a couple minutes of progress, all tolerable)  rebalanced, and with new DLC added, I can finally say this game is very enjoyable and worth the price.  \nMy advise for anyone who wants to go remotely fast, definitely put points in reflex, with 20 points not being a waste.  Dashing everywhere is so incredibly satisfying both during and out of combat, as well as time saving.\n\nI already completed the game once when patch 1.5 came out, and had my fun.\nAfter starting fresh with the new patch 2.0 and beyond, I can safely say this game was very enjoyable, if ultimately quite easy.  Beat the game entirely on Very Hard with only the early game being a bit touch at times.  It fulfills that power fantasy itch very well.\n\nMy visible complaint is (aside from the crashes) that there are still some blueprints and gear that you just can't return to go get when you miss them, when I feel you really should be able to (quest specific path gear notwithstanding).\nMy only other complaint is the Second Heart cyberware not working when i fall to my death... it [b] literally [/b] says it prevents death upon hitting 0 health... but falling death is exempt?  Get outta here with that bullcrap.  While falling deaths never happened to me by mid-late game, it urked the hell out of me early on.\n\nMy only major complaint is DLC spoiler territory, and I guess its fairly minor all things considered as I liked 95% of the DLC content:  [spoiler] I absolutely hated the mock Alien Isolation section of the game at the end of the DLC.  Here is my absolute monstrosity of a character, nigh unkillable... and you put a one-shot, ultra speed AI Killbot with no counter play other than hiding like a wimp?!  And once again, my second heart means nothing...  What is wrong with you CD Project?!  Way to kill the pacing real hard with that section when playing as any type of character other than stealthy mchidegood. [/spoiler]\n\nOverall, I still recommend this game, especially when on sale.",

The game is in a state after many years where the initial vision for the game has been fully realized. Not to mention the story is great, especially with the addition of Phantom Liberty. Honestly, Phantom Liberty fits so seamlessly into the rest of the game that I wouldn't even really consider it DLC, it's more very fleshed out content that's part of the same game. \n\nTLDR \nBuy the game and Phantom Liberty, they're great 9/10.",

Everything is fine until Keanu Reaves shows up. He beats you up, but you feel no pain. Because this is all actually a dream! You wake up in a field full of mud and corpses. Keanu Reaves is wearing a speedo and walks up to you. He says \"Wake the fuck up Soldier, we've got a war to fight\". It is after this you discover, that you are on the front lines in the Isreal vs Palestine war. You must choose a side or you will be cancelled on twitter. This game is great 8/10",

Normally 30 fps on many games look ass but cyberpunk did an amazing job to make 30 fps look silky smooth. The bugs have been almost all demolished and its rare to encounter a game breaking bug, and i can assure you there is no bug that will soft lock you like spider man 2. its a hard game to get into too, not everyone will actually enjoy they game but when you do get into it its hard to part ways with the game. do please try the game out.",

I played pre-v2.0 so count my review as for that iteration though I'm sure 2.0 has brough many improvements too.\n\nThis is truly one of my favourite games of all time. The city is immersive and you can choose to live V's life however you like. I chose to be a stealthy head-shotting merc but I've also seen videos of people becoming katana welding ninjas.\n\nWhat really makes this game is the characters. They have personality and are so believable that you feel like you'll either get to like or dislike them as you would with genuine people, forming relationships that mean something more than just being a sidekick in a game. The voice acting is really on point too with plenty of emotion.\n\nI'd recommend this game whole-heartedly to anyone. #teampanam",

Story lines are pretty cool. I have enjoyed the game and had zero problems once I repurchased it on Steam since GoG would never update past 1.03 for me. Currently downloading Phantom Liberty to restart again and see it all a new with the latest content. \n\nGreat game to play casually and grow over time or to totally dive into and obsess over in my opinion. I bounce from game to game and just obsess until I burn out then go back to another and keep rotating. I always come back to this one on a regular basis because it is really fun for me to play.",

I´ve enjoyed Cyberpunk 2077 since day one, granted it had issues but luckily I never experienced any game breaking bugs. I bought it on steam to play it on my steam deck and it works really well on that device. Then when they released the 2.0 update the game got so much better and Phantom Liberty made it even better. I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes the Cyberpunk genre or RPG´s. Huge Thumbs up.",

I highly recommend playing the DLC along with the main game, It fleshes out the character that you make into a more relatable one and it ties so well to the main story. I think the main story is a little bit too short and i wish some of the endings were a bit different from each other but apart from that it has great combat, good driving, great voice acting and great visuals. Highly recommend this game but man it does make you feel empty after finishing it. (In a good way)",

Just remember that under the slick visuals and top tier voice acting, you're buying a goofy, buggy game; if you forget, the game will remind you quickly enough.",

Ironically the DLC Phantom Liberty just so happened to release not long before I decided to buy the game. I'm glad I bought the game a lot later than most did because I got to play the improved game. It wasn't super buggy for me like a lot of peoples 1st experience of the game is. This was my 1st single player game in a very long time and I think that I got very lucky! Cyberpunk 2077 became my new favorite game! Genuinely LOVED the game! For me it was like when you have a really good book you like and you never want it to end type of thing. Unfortunately all good thing must come to and end and I beat the game. I have went back and did all of the different variations of the end game. Play for yourself to experience the very well put together game! No spoilers! The only thing I would suggest is download a collection mod pack. I know some people have mixed feelings about no playing the vanilla version but I promise with a good mod pack you will get a much greater experience. Nevertheless the game doesn't really need them, it's more of a QOL thing. This game had me hooked from the 1st mission! I grew into the game. I felt like it was more than immersion, more like I actually felt some strong emotions while playing some missions. Story writing is phenomenal! 10/10 would recommend the game! A very engaging game.",

Had issues where the radio would just stop playing and reloading from a save would not fix, nor would exiting the game. It would just start working again after a few days of playing. Some issues with NPCs getting stuck under an object and not being able to kill or target them for quick hacks. Would have to leave the area for them to stop being alerted, then come back after they walked around. Mostly happened when in Dogtown in areas with dirt hills and you were looking an air drop. Also other random things with not being able to loot an NPC, because their dropped item is under the ground.\n\n**SPOILERS AHEAD**\n\n\n\n\n\n[spoiler] Lastly, I would like to say it was a great game and an overall good alternative end to the V saga, but I was disappointed with no path having a true happy ending. The fact that most of them ended in a manner where most of your friends don't even seem to really care that you were gone, shows that all your work with relations made no difference. Pretty disappointing.  [/spoiler]",

The game is beautiful with memorable characters and a okay story. \nI really enjoyed the combat, driving, and character customization. Some of the side content moves a bit too slow for my tastes.\nHighly recommend the DLC if you enjoy the base game.",

                "review": "I pre-ordered Cyberpunk for the PS4 and played it on a PS5 day one. I ran into one bug that wasn't a big deal but certainly immersion breaking. I stopped playing shortly after the game allows you to roam around Night City as I saw the major backlash on social media and how bad of a state it was in. Up until I stopped playing I was really loving what Cyberpunk had shown me; the initial missions are SO good and had me on the edge of my seat.\n\nHowever, seeing the backlash and knowing that I payed full price for essentially a beta pushed me into getting a PSN refund. I knew patches would be released and eventually the game would be in a better state but by that time I also knew the game would be heavily discounted to coax players back in. I didn't know it would take 3 years but I'm glad I waited. Once 2.0 update hit I bought Cyberpunk + Phantom Liberty for $50 and jumped back in. The base game was still at the high level I had experienced 3 years ago but the expansion Phantom Liberty really takes things to a much higher level. While I do think the gameplay seems a bit off with the enemy AI, it's not too bad! The story is what you're here for and I did not feel disappointed at all. The high points are extremely high and get the blood pumping. Base game is without a doubt worthy of a purchase but getting both the base + expansion make this (IMHO) a necessary buy. Especially if you enjoyed Witcher 3s mission story structure of how nothing is what it first appears to be.\n\nIt's obvious though after playing Phantom Liberty of what this game could have been if the Dev Team had more time. The expansion to me was 10x better than the base game. In the base game you have Main Missions, Side Missions then Mini-Side Missions referred to as \"Gigs\". The Side Missions are very good and have actual story lines going for them. Majority of the \"Gigs\" in the base game are extremely basic and simplistic but in the expansion you could confuse them as full on Side Missions that don't expand as much as the multiple Side Missions. Each \"Gig\" had a hard, big, choice at the end with a major plot twist. Phantom Liberty makes me very excited for the future and how Cyberpunk 2 will (hopefully) shape up.\n\n117 hours to complete my first play-through and I loved every second of it.",

                "review": "----- TL/DR -----\n8/10\n\n+ Great visually\n+ Extremely immersive environment\n+ Great plot\n+ Great characters\n+ Great fighting mechanics\n\n± 50 hours gameplay /w sidequests\n\n- Way, way, way too much dialog\n- Story progression is a bit clumsy at times\n- Story needs more intrinsic motivators\n\nAll in all a solid recommendation, but probably not at the full price. Wait for a discount.\n\n----- Long form -----\nIt is interesting in that you can clearly see and feel that this game was made by the Witcher devs. They've fixed some of the major issues with The Witcher (better fighting mechanics, more lively/populated environment) but it has a much more clunky story and too much dialog, but the immersion can mostly compensate for these issues.\n\n[b]Dialogue[/b]\nThe Witcher III had lots of dialog as well, but it was much more interesting and I never, even on my 3rd play-through, skipped a dialog in the Witcher III, but in CP2077 I spent probably a an hour of the gameplay pressing Y to fast forward.... I feel they could've skipped 80% of the dialogue and nothing would've been lost. At times it seemed the dialogue was just a tool to lengthen the gameplay time.\n\n[b]Story[/b]\nThe story progression was also not as good as in The Witcher III. In comparison, the progression feels sometimes a bit unnatural and not well paced. It is still a good story, but I think more could've been done with the great plot that they have here.\n\nThey also missed some very obvious great intrinsic motivators for the story, like revenge. The only intrinsic motivator for the main story that they focus on is the drive to survive, but there are other good motivators. The motivation to get better gear and more eddies ($$$) applies to side quest, which is fine, but the main story was a bit lackluster in that regard. \n\n[b]Immersion & Characters[/b]\nBut all these issues are mostly overshadowed by the interesting plot, good and diverse characters and the unbelievable immersive, lively and detailed world. In the Witcher III, while visually (still) very stunning, the world felt eerily empty and void of life. That issue has been completely fixed with CP2077. There are so many unique characters that I am still astonished that it is even technically possible to do this at such a scale. \n\nThe main characters are all very unique make it a very immersive story. The voice acting (at least in english) was fantastic. But I am shocked they did not include a cameo of Doug Cockle (voice of Geralt) somewhere, that would've been hilarious. \n\nWhile all the characters felt very real and were animated and voice-acted very well, although one thing bugged me from the very beginning. There is no connection between the protagonist and the main characters. If we compare it to the Witcher III, from the very beginning of the game they try to build a connection between all the characters. So after a few hours into the game you start to actually feel a connection to the other main characters, which is almost completely lacking in CP2077. \n\nMost of the main characters in CP2077 are people you have just met and almost instantly become an integral part of the story without building any form of bond with them. It feels very unnatural.\n\n[b]Combat[/b]\nCombat is surprisingly fun and diverse. You can choose between many different weapons and hacks. This provides also a great motivator to replay the game and try different things. But the game also allows you to do a \"Jack of all trades, master of none\" and do everything at once, which is very fun IMO. \n\nThe devs have put as much as possible in the game in terms of fighting mechanics, and I think there is a fighting style for everyone in this game.\n\n[b]Conclusion[/b]\nCyberpunk 2077 is a great game, which provides a fun game experience with almost 50 hours of gameplay (mainstory + sidequest / without DLC). If you can get the base game at a discount (below $50) then I most definitely recommend it. \n\nDo not be discouraged by the Memes that discredit this game, it is very well optimized and is very fun.",

Some with merit (the crashes and bugs) but most of the blowback online was the usual unrealistic expectations. Objectively: the game was still a great first person action RPG upon release 10th of december 2020 (despite the crashes). I completed Cyberpunk 2077 the first time on a PS4 Pro within a couple of weeks. In 2023 I completed the game on a PC with a 4090.  Both times was a great experience. After 3 years of fixes and improvements the game has gone from great to amazing - up in the same league as The Witcher 3. Just sit down and enjoy this extremely atmospheric, story rich melting pot of carefully balanced game systems. If there is something you don't like: Mod it. That is all.",

                "review": "Played this game when it first came out, version 1.1 that used to absolutely murder my RTX 2080. DLSS was a bad implementation that made everything blurry, and I couldn't get a steady 60 fps without a lot of tweaking and messing around with the graphics settings for a long time. I wouldn't even dare enable any ray tracing feature, that was out of the question. And yet I really enjoyed it, it ran ok and didn't run into any game breaking bugs, despite hearing everywhere only complaints. There were of course some funny glitches here and there, but at the time of writing this, there still are, but it's not very often or annoying. Re-installed after the 2.0 update, this time with a bit beefier card and now I still can't say that it runs butter smooth, but it is a much better graphical experience. I can finally use DLSS and crank everything to high, activate all the ray tracing features and still get around 60 fps with a 3080 Ti. It was nice to get back into the universe after a couple of years, felt like I never took a break. The world feels original, and weird. In a good way. The gun play is awesome, and rewarding, the cars are bad ass looking, and everyone smokes everywhere, apparently eastern Europe takes over NUSA in 50 years, so watch out.",

But, let me finish my story first. So, while I was on one of the ending quests game got bugged and I had a glitch which allowed me to skip the scene and choose my own path, that's why I survived. \nNow, I feel great, married Silverhand, (now he's Silverhead) we are also especially grateful to talented MODDERS! We have everything we wish! Sometimes all this bugging, but we still love and enjoy our live in the Night City! <3\n\nSo, how did I survive? Let me keep it on secret, please! >D\n",

On launch I couldn't even play through character creation without it crashing. Welp, couple years go by and I built myself a pc. This game was on sale and I thought I'd give it another shot, I bought it with the launch of Phantom Liberty update 2.0 . I have to admit, I'm actually really enjoying the game. If you got burned by this game like I did, I highly recommend giving it another try.",

With the 2.0 update, the game feels like it now has a more clear direction for its gameplay, an easier approach to builds, the reworked vehicle handling, as well as all the new additions with Phantom Liberty, such as new weapons, the relic upgrades, the new ending, and of course the new district, Dogtown, which is by far one of the most detailed and dense locations ever made in an open world. It really stands out, and the story of Solomon and So Mi is one of the best subplots Cyberpunk has to offer, with many twists, turns and tensions rising. I loved the game at launch, and I continue to love it now, and as much as I absolutely obsessed over Witcher 3, I gotta say, I think Cyberpunk has it beat when it comes to dialogue and animations and overall story pacing. Can't wait to see whats in store for the next Witcher or Cyberpunk 2.",

I'm so glad I did. The 2.0 patch is amazing. It is like a whole new game. Everything about this game now is fantastic. CDPR really turned it around. I also bought the DLC and even after only playing that for a couple of hours, it is some of the best DLC I've played. It could be a standalone game. Cyberpunk is one of the best games I have ever played and I am so glad that CDPR continued to work on this game and fix all of those issues that were present at launch. It is unrecognisable from how it was. It is a must play.",

                "review": "I've been gaming since Atari 2600, I've experienced hundreds and hundreds of video games, slowly but surely watching them become better and better in every aspect. For years Fallout 2, Snatcher, Syndicate, and Shadowrun were the game that left a lasting impression on my life in so many ways. The Cyberpunk genre, just really entices me. For years some games came close to giving me that feeling; Skyrim, Fallout 3 and 4 to a name a few. When I heard Cyberpunk 2077 had a terrible release, I told myself to just wait and see what happens. \n\nBy far the best move I made. \n\nNever in my life have I played a game that has such a feel for realism by simply adding in things that don't need to be there, but as a whole make you feel as if you're in it. From a tweaker on the ground having seizures, to a random police crime scenes, a guy holding his girlfriend as she pukes, to burrows based on ethnicity, and holy shit the performance by Lizzy Party Music Scene - \"You Know My Name\" Song Scene (Just this quest line and scene alone made Phantom Liberty amazing). The body language and voice acting make you feel like you're in a real goddamn movie. \n\nI could go on and on, but I'll say it, by far the best open world RPG I've ever played, but it got here by standing on the shoulders of giants. Much thanks to Black Isle studios, William Gibson, Hideo Kojima, FASA, and many others to help this game become one of the best. \n\nRLTW",

Honestly Cyberpunk has not changed much from the launch, maybe gotten 20% better, but people act like it was garbage and now it's the second coming of Christ. But that's the current climate, youtubers create drama to milk views and children parrot those talking points. Don't miss out on this game, arguably this one has the best story on any video game ever, not saying it's flawless, but for me it's hard to think other video games that have quests that aren't just adequate slop. 8.5/10.",

The game was rushed, it isn't that long, and it lacks replayability but it's the best game in this kind of setting ever made and it has some great stories to boot. Outside of the story  and the setting I would say the cybernetics add the most to the game with some of them totally changing the gameplay. Overall I'd say get it on sale because while what's there is excellent it's only about 60 hours long and has little in the way of replay value.",

                "review": "Cyberpunk 2077 brings alive the genre and world originally created by William Gibson with the Sprawl trilogy he released back in the 80s.  The world can't be interacted with as much as you'd find in similar titles, but its lore is deep and its world building (from a story perspective) is some of the best I've ever experienced.   \n\nI don't feel it's a game with re-playability in mind for existing saves.  I don't think this is necessarily a bad thing; doing all main jobs and gigs took me 150+ hours.   While the DLC adds some re-playable events, the game felt definitively done once all scripted tasks were completed.  \n\nGameplay has improved substantially since its initial release, although its still not entirely bug free.  While its RPG mechanics and systems don't feel as strong as similar titles, I enjoyed every moment of exploring Night City and learning how it and the people live there came to be.   \n",

I have never seen something so dense with detail in every single possible corner, street, alley way, apartment, sewer, lobby, and city center. It is insane, this is the next generation game people would hope to see, and CDPR did not forget. In my opinion this game is fully redeemed. Combat is amazing and fairly deep, weapons feel fantastic, and the mods add an extra layer if you wanna jump into it. \n\nThe story, while not varying too much in your choices till the last few hours, will drag you in with its insanely well animated characters, and flavored dialogue. This game makes you feel like you are in Night City. You are a merc, your name is V, and you get to just be V, and all that he/she comes with. \n\nIf you like open world games, and sci-fi settings this shouldn't be missed, there isn't anyone else doing anything like this as well as CDPR. This seamless, with this much style. It really is something to behold.",

                "review": "after a very long hiatus of not playing this game i can say now that it is very awesome and more so. insanely large map for several plot points to take place, which is insane world building imo. the weapon selection is just to die for. the cars are stunning, and in general everything has this techno grime about it. especially the \"budget\" weapons(same could be said for cars, id honestly kill for a cheap 2077 car if they were real). despite being insanely weak in the game they are probably stronger than any average weapon we have today, and have a car battery slammed jerry-rigged nature about them, really shows the the futuristic theme in weaponry where the median guns are Geneva rule breakers and the cheapo weapons are military powerhouses. \n\nthe new content they have added over the updates (when im saying this im excluding the phantom liberty dlc, haven't played it yet sadly) is phenomenal and changes endings in many ways, i always thought siding with arasaka was the saddest but most well written, but my thoughts may have changed. in other words, they basically released the goddamn Snyder cut for a videogame of all things",

The different builds (netrunner, technical etc.) have nice depth and feel to them compared to other RPG classes (warlock, mage, knight etc).  The cyberware adjustments is a fresh take on gear that makes it feels unique and it has an impact. I have been having a great time just running around in Night City and partaking in random events and side quests. \n\nThe driving in this game is hilariously wonky but I do enjoy it.\n\nCons:\n\nThe game is intensive on your pc and the recent 2.0 patches introduced an increase stress load for both heat and ability of your components. \n",

Only in Cyberpunk, all side missions are way more fun than the main ones and in each stage of side missions, you can choose to go all-out guns blazing or stay stealthy. All the NPCs feel like \"statues\" so don't expect a lively atmosphere in the game.. Just enjoy the storyline and complete every gig! Night city also beautiful to ride at night\n\n",

                "review": "Cyberpunk 2077 will go down as one of the top ten games that I have ever played. I will admit that game had a no man's sky launch, however the devs did not give up with 2.0 putting the game in an amazing state. Game play mechanics aside, I think this game is a 10/10 for the storytelling. The characters are full of life and you can make deep friendships. The city pulls you into the life of a Night City citizen, showing the dystopian nature between corpos and the homeless. There is no \"fairy tale\" happy ending to this game. The heart and soul of Cyberpunk 2077 was to show how V can find solace in the midst of a society that aggressively takes more and more of your humanity away. I genuinely believe that most people could play out this story to the end, remembering key moments long after they finish the game. \n\nOn top of that, this game has one of the best prologues I have ever played, immediately pulling me into the world. The exploration of Night City is chalked full of hidden weapons, side quests, and \"shards\" (lore tabs) for the player to find. One of the few games I rarely used the fast travel; driving around with Night City Radio on was a vibe. The character customisation is great. Combat is a ton of fun with the 2.0 update. If you want to become Adam Smasher 2.0 on the verge of cyberpsychosis, you can. Just watch out for MaxTac. MaxTac and other bosses are a bit of a challenge; you can't spam heals and you have to watch your cyberware cooldowns. \n\nI would 100% recommend trying this experience. Exploration, combat, and story are all amazing. Also, watch the anime Cyberpunk Edgerunners it ties into the game very well.",

The cyberpunk/spy atmosphere you experience with this game is 12/10. What more could one ask for? The game runs buttery smooth (4070 RTX). I didn't encounter any major game-breaking bugs or bugs in general, besides some small graphical glitches. Not sure what else to say, besides the fact that the chooms at CDPR did an outstanding job with this DLC. Thank you CDPR! And thank you for ukrainian localization!\n\n",

The story is amazing, the character customization is great, the combat is fun as hell, and all the 2.0 changes made everything even better. All the lore and backstory sucks you even further into the world of Cyberpunk. I highly recommend anyone looking for a great single player game to give Cyberpunk a shot if they were turned off by the negativity at release.",

There's still some wonky moments and the driving still feels like it was designed by someone who has never actually drove a car, but it doesn't interfere with the fun. This game is now the masterful project it was advertised to be.",

Characters are interesting and conversations are best in the market because they are dynamic.\n\nCombat, Weapons, cyber-implants are good and fun to use. The implementation of Smart and Tech weapons along the Power (Ricochet) weapons is good and I hope more games do that.\n\nPerk tree is average+. Some perks are bad, some are very good. Perks from Cool really enhance stealth.\n\nFighting bosses as NetRunner doesn't really work so bring some smart shotgun to take them down.\n\nYes there are still some bugs, like Bosses T-pose every now and then.\n\nThere are some minor flaws as well.\n- Missions where you have to tail another car are nightmare because they fail if they get like 50m ahead of you.\n- Cars with guns are pointless since they never hit anything\n\nOverall solid 9/10 - highly recommended.",

Certainly one of the more memorable tales I have experienced.",

Want to be a walking tank like Adam Smasher and bulldoze guns blazing...you can do that. \n\nA blade wielding...in hand or in your arms...samurai badass who can use bullet time to dash about and dice the enemy into sashimi....you can do it \n\nA stealthy hacker who sets traps around the room or turns an enemies cybernetics against them? well you guessed it you can do it. You can even add in monowire to slap them with hacks as you dance about the room. \n\nThats just a few different ways and there so much mix and match I have my own head spinning and itching for more chrome. \n\nSimply put...this is a must play. Play it once...play it so you master every ending...play each run different! V is there to have a good time and a long time. \n\nI'm very glad this game got the treatment it deserved and is a single player game I can sink myself into. I personally have not had that since Elden Ring. I cant wait to finish my first run and then do another with another playstyle and background. Its been a long while since I had a game make me want to try each and every style it can bring and I want to try everything this game can do.",

The ambient song Just Another Weapon plays softly in the background during this scene. Chef’s kiss.",

Which subsequently meant I lost interest and never made it out of Watson, but now with the 2.0 update I have to say I am enjoying this game more then I ever thought I would or could and I can't wait to continue playing and finally experience the full story of this game. I just want to thank CDPR for not giving up on this game like so many other developers would have and finally giving us one of the best games I have had the pleasure of playing over the past few years",

A good, if not great, story-centric FPS RPG game deserving of your time, if not your money.\nHowever...\nWith the right mods (courtesy of NexusMods), like a gun combat overhaul and certain QoL cheats + Cosmetic changes? The game (especially post 2.0+ perk/attribute reworks/builds) becomes a borderline masterpiece. Where it can be very challenging, immersive in its roleplay, and even go as far as to let you cosplay characters from the Edgerunners show, more or less.\nIt goes from a good game because of its story and writing, to a genuinely challenging experience that immerses you into the role of an Edgerunner that needs to chromes up to stay ahead and survive, with a genuinely good, touching story to boot!\n\nAs of writing, I'm currently on the tail-end of my Streetkid \"Rebecca V\" run, and I'm already dreading the ending. Not because it'd be a bad/disatisfying one, but because my V's story, so far, would be over. Like most beautiful things in Night City, they don't last long, and rarely get anything more than bittersweet endings. \nBut even so, I'd do it all again, like it was the first time.\nSo,\nToast to David Martinez, Maine, Rebecca, Johnny, and Jackie\nTo the chooms loved and lost \nTo this \no/",

                "review": "Heralded as one of the most anticipated games of its generation, Cyberpunk 2077 emerged from the masterminds at CD Projekt Red, the team celebrated for their work on The Witcher series.\n\nCyberpunk 2077 is a highly ambitious open-world role-playing game set in the sprawling metropolis of Night City. The title promised a deeply immersive dystopian experience rich with narrative depth, intricate character development, and a bustling world ripe for exploration.\n\nDive deep into the heart of corporate espionage, mercenary life, and existential crisis. But remember, the story isn't just about avenging your fallen comrade or dealing with a rogue AI; it's also about those unexpected moments like when your car spawns inside a building. Ah, the tales you'll tell!\n\nVisually, the game is stunning, especially when characters don't randomly T-pose to assert dominance or when your motorcycle doesn't decide to take flight. The neon lights, the rain-slicked streets, and the jaw-dropping vistas make it easy to forget that your character might be walking around with missing pants—yes, even if you're sure you put them on. The city's aesthetic captures the essence of a cyberpunk dystopia, juxtaposing the glitzy lives of corporate moguls with the grim reality of gang-infested neighbourhoods. Character models, vehicles, and interiors exhibit meticulous detail, reinforcing the immersive nature of the game world.\n\nAt its core, Cyberpunk 2077 revolves around V, a customisable (from your eyes to your... more intimate areas) protagonist, and their intertwining fate with Johnny Silverhand, a digital ghost portrayed by Keanu Reeves. The plot traverses themes of identity, freedom, and the fight against oppressive corporatism. While the central story line captivates, the side quests and incidental stories found in the nooks and crannies of Night City often steal the show, delivering the depth and narrative nuance CD Projekt Red is known for.\n\nBetween the gunfights, hacking, and dialogues, you might encounter your car acting like a trampoline or an NPC defying the laws of physics. But don't let that distract you! Instead, take it as an added mini-game: \"Spot the Oopsy.\" Winner gets bragging rights and a free trip to the local Ripperdoc to check for potential cyberpsychosis.\n\nCyberpunk 2077 is a masterpiece of chaos, minor glitches, and raw potential. Strap in, grab your malfunctioning cyberdeck, and embark on a journey filled with more unexpected laughs than a comedy club on a Saturday night. And always remember to check if you're wearing pants before you leave V's apartment. It's a wild world out there!\n\nWhen it shines, it offers moments of narrative brilliance, breathtaking world design, and engrossing gameplay.\n\nNote - the game is now nearly three years old and continues to receive updates. It runs very well on ultra settings on mid-range graphics cards like the AMD 7800XT or Nvidia RTX4070.",

I only ran into 1 game-breaking bug that forced my to reload a save 2-hours prior, and all other bugs were visual, like cars and people occasionally popping out of nowhere.\nWhile Cyberpunk 2077 doesn't quite live up to Witcher 3, the cyberpunk aesthetic feels new and different in gaming, the game looks amazing, the gameplay is nice, and the DLC is pretty good. \nThe only real complaint is that most of the quests involve \"Follow around this NPC that is walking 2 miles-per-hour for 2-minutes while they occasionally talk about something\". I imagine there's a mod to speed that up, but I thought modern games* were past this type of storytelling\n*I've heard Starfield still does this, but I've also heard that Starfield feels like a game from 2015, so it might be a stretch to call it a \"modern game\"",

                "review": "After playing through Cyberpunk 2077 once, checking out all endings and finishing the DLC, I can confidently say, CP2077 may be one of the best games I've ever played.\nLooking at games, that reach a similar status in my ranking, I can extract the essence why it ranks among RDR2 and Witcher 3 in my TOP 5: \n\nExtra-ordinary immersiveness.\n\nWhat does a game need to do to let you feel this?\nWell, imo it needs to fulfill three criteria:\n1. Good narrative: \nA good story needs good written characters and a compelling plot. It must move the player emotionally and deliver some sort of deeper message. It must also explore and enrich the setting. \nThe story fulfills all of these things, the base game has some problems, atleast in its main quest: You can clearly tell that content was cut and compressed, especially the last third of the game. Of course, this was unfixable with an update. \nThe characters are exceptional, and the lore of the world is very fleshed out. \nThe endings are commonly described as very depressing, maybe they are, but they are all are a perfect conclusion of what it means trying to make footprint between all of these mega corps in this capitalistic dystopia.\n\n2. Presentation:\nThis is not only about graphics, which should be ad least good, but most important coherent and reliable. The game is not allowed to rember you that you are playing a game. CPs graphics are superb, and break now very little.\nCP has no loading screens through the whole game, nada. It's a miracle.\nAlso, animations. They're very good, in the DLC they're perfect. The crux are the NPCs, which must be very human like, but still follow the rules of the fantasy. That's something very hard to pull off, and that's why I think that VR will be used for more something like CP2077 than something like WoW. \nAlso the dialogues. The times of freezing and frame centered NPCs that stare directly into your soul are over. The NPCs in this game move around and do stuff while talking, you move around, you drink beer, stir soup, and so on while talking.\nThe only change I would consider is that menus like map and inventory should be non pausing.\n3. Gameplay\nIn this part the game must deliver on the power fantasy. It does it very well. The skill system is sensible, the fighting is fun.\nI played a netrunner based build which relied on smart guns for fire power. So I have nothing to say about the melee combat, this will be thoroughly checked during my second playthrough.\n\nIn the end I bow to the devs for finally delivering on their original vision. The road was tough, mistakes were made and lessons HOPEFULLY learnt. This is the new benchmark for all the story based single player openworld games out there, in every aspect.",

There are some issue like minor bug, some identical NPCs on the street, but all those are not really hinder the overall almost perfect experience.\n\ngameplay 8.5/10\nstory 9.5/10\nmusic 10/10",

                "review": "Game version : 2.0\nOverall playing time : 95h\nPercentage of game completed : 100%\n\nProbably the best game I've played in recent years. \n\nI spent almost 100 hours discovering the nooks and crannies of NightCity as V. At first glance, the Open-World is incredible, and whether you're traveling by vehicle, on foot or via teleporters, I had a great time visiting the map. There are a few weak points, however. NPCs on foot seem to be part of the scenery (apart from a few rare exceptions) and in cars, NPCs seem to be absent, giving way to a very rudimentary driving script.\n\nThe main and secondary scenarios are very well written, and the immersion in V's story and in the Cyberpunk universe is just perfect. A few allusions to the Edgerunners series reinforce the game's universe and story. The various romances (depending on the gender of your character) add a new layer of emotion to a game that aspires to thrill its players. When it comes to the game's various aspects (DLC included), the word that seems to best describe them is perfect. The universe and the character take us towards different ends, but with a single objective : to make us feel deep emotions again !\n\nAs for the Phatom Liberty DLC, it adds another level to the game's writing and storyline. With cinematics worthy of action films and characters with new exciting stories. I clearly saw a huge difference between the original story and the one in the DLC, and this heralds a second opus of unprecedented quality!\n\nThank you CD PROJEKT for this game, and I'm looking forward to the next one!",

I don't usually give reviews but I'm so impressed by CDPR's committment to turning this nightmare around that I had to give this a thumbs up. Yes, you failed us, CDPR. But you took the backlash on the chin and didn't stop until the game was right and I really appreciate that. In over 40 hours of gameplay post patch 2.02 I only encountered one really major bug and it almost made me nostalgic when I saw that car fly through a bridge and explode for no reason. Apart from that, almost nothing in terms of glitches. Well done, and please don't do this to us ever again.",

                "review": "An incredibly unique RPG like no other.\n\nSome people might compare this to GTA but this is a full RPG with levels, perks and story choices. CDPR nailed the futuristic sci-fi noir feeling when roaming through the streets full of neon signs reflecting off wet surfaces in the rain, I've waited so long for a game like this. Although the main story revolves around being a thief there are a lot of Bladerunner like detective stories on the side you can immerse yourself in making this a true role playing game.\n\nThe city is incredibly detailed with lots of well crafted areas hidden within it. I found myself walking and enjoying the sights more than driving when I only needed to travel short distances. There's also a huge area outside the city looking more like a wasteland from Mad Max with matching cloths and vehicles if you want to live out that fantasy instead.\n\nThere is a lot of content here, like any open world RPG. There are lots of unique and interesting side quests that are gradually added over time so it doesn't feel overwhelming. I found the gameplay to be extremely fun, going far beyond most typical games giving you choices like smart/tech weapons, katanas, rocket arms, wire and blade options built into your hands and my favorite of all, you can use swords on bikes!\n\nIt took me a long time to get to this review because I wasn't happy with the state of the game at launch but now it's really amazing, I highly recommend it. My one and only negative is that I had to wait this long for all the updates that should of been there at launch.",

All in all this game is so fun the story is great and from what I've heard phantom liberty is great too. I love Jonny Silverhand, He is probably one of my favorite characters in fiction. but yeah 9/10",

Already played 20h before the big update on PC and yeah, I already loved the story and world so far, but combat and NPC mechanics were a T-posing mess. But now? Masterpiece. Damn I want to forget everything and play this game again, go through every choice and every ending again because it's so goddamn good and left me an emotional wreck at some points.

This is, especially now with the 2.0 update, a masterpiece, a word I try not to use lightly.\n\nThere are a lot of long reviews already, so I will keep it short. I struggle to remember any other game I played in the past that touched me, moved me and made me feel so empty, so sad when it was over as this one. And all the while I had a blast playing it.\n\nSo yeah, it's a masterpiece of a game that reminds me, that even with the bad state it was in at release, CD PROJEKT RED created something that had and still has no equal. Probably won't until they release another Witcher game or a sequel.",

I ran a Katana Sande build on very hard and had a lot of fun throughout, the gigs were fun and side jobs were plenty and fun and it was nice seeing the Edgerunners content since I had seen that before playing the game, so getting the items from that like Davids jacket and Rebeccas shotgun was a nice treat. Theres an occasional glitch or two here and there, for me a big glitch was this Hud glitch you get after completeing a main quest but they patched that and another glitch where one of the fixer's gigs never becomes open for you to do (looking at you Dakota). Overall this game is a nice 8.5/10",

Really fun gameplay with diverse builds, engaging quests, and well-developed characters, along with some of the best graphics and atmosphere in the gaming world.\n\t[/list]\n\n[h1]Playtime[/h1]\n\t[list]\n\t\t[*]+100 hours. Very Hard difficulty.\n\t[/list]\n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n\t[list]\n\t\t[*]Really good looking game with very detailed assets. Story characters are very detailed with impressive facial and body animation. I like to stroll around the city, just appreciating the visuals.\n\t[/list]\n\t[list]\n\t\t[*]A lot of varied locations with different building designs, lighting and assets.\n\t[/list]\n\t[list]\n\t\t[*]Despite not being a traditional dark gloomy cyberpunk game I still think the atmosphere in this game is really nice, specially when there aren't any NPCs bugging nearby.\n\t[/list]\n\t[list]\n\t\t[*]Really good voice actors for the story sections.\n\t[/list]\n\t[list]\n\t\t[*]Interesting characters for the main story and some of the side missions and gigs.\n\t[/list]\n\t[list]\n\t\t[*]I like the bounty system. It's simple, but it just gives you a reason to shoot up thugs outside of quests without the police bothering you.\n\t[/list]\n\t[list]\n\t\t[*]The size of the map is pretty reasonably big considering how detailed the world is.\n\t[/list]\n\t[list]\n\t\t[*]Your max carry weight is pretty 'generous' (and you can expand it even more with perks) and a lot of items don't weight anything. This is nice because you spend less time micro-managing your inventory which can be annoying.\n\t[/list]\n\t[list]\n\t\t[*]While I didn't like radio music much, the ambient and combat music are usually really good and atmospheric.\n\t[/list]\n\t[list]\n\t\t[*]All cars have unique interiors and they all look pretty good.\n\t[/list]\n\t[list]\n\t\t[*]Side missions and gigs can be really interesting, there's a bit of variation to them, I expected them to be a lot worse and generic. Some of the plots in Side missions even rival the main quest.\n\t[/list]\n\t[list]\n\t\t[*]Combat in 2.0 is really fun regardless of your build.\n\t[/list]\n\t[list]\n\t\t[*]I do like the stealth system, not my favorite, but it's fun.\n\t[/list]\n\t[list]\n\t\t[*]The main story/quest was ok, it had its moments, but I expected more from its final moments.\n\t[/list]\n\t[list]\n\t\t[*]The gore system is pretty good. Taking out a huge chunk of an enemy's body part with a sniper shot is always fun.\n\t[/list]\n\t[list]\n\t\t[*]I like the new cyberware system. Upgrading your cyberware throughout the game is really fun and rewarding.\n\t[/list]\n\t[list]\n\t\t[*]On 'Very Hard' the game can be pretty challenging and fun. I think the level scaling implemented in 2.0 worked really well, it kept the game interesting until the very endgame.\n\t[/list]\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n\t[list]\n\t\t[*]Lots of bug still in +2.0.\n\t[/list]\n\t[list]\n\t\t[*]There's not as many choices in the main quest as CDPR make it out to be. V's three 'lifepaths' also converge pretty quickly into a single practically identical story.\n\t[/list]\n\t[list]\n\t\t[*]There are a few exceptions, but I didn't like most of the music played on the radio in the game.\n\t[/list]\n\t[list]\n\t\t[*]The 'Journal' in the game is pretty useless. Instead of telling the current and past events of a quest in a concise way, it's just a Silverhand/V's ramble about what's going in their mind at the time, which most often than not doesn't tell you anything about your current point in the quest.\n\t[/list]\n\t[list]\n\t\t[*]Killing 'normal enemies' with non-lethal methods doesn't give you more XP or seem to have any impact on the story.\n\t[/list]\n\t[list]\n\t\t[*]In some areas there's way too much background noise, usually you have multiple stereos (playing shitty music) and speakers of 'ad screens' playing at the same time. It might be a 'realistic' depiction of a cyberpunk future, but it's just extremely annoying.\n\t[/list]\n\t[list]\n\t\t[*]A lot of stuff promised by CDPR is still not in the game.\n\t[/list]\n\n[h1]Minor Gripes[/h1]\n\t[list]\n\t\t[*]Using the 'Quick Melee Attack' makes you stand up from crouching position.\n\t[/list]\n\t[list]\n\t\t[*]Important NPCs sometimes walk through you during conversations.\n\t[/list]\n\t[list]\n\t\t[*]No options to cancel the 'Skip Time' action midway through.\n\t[/list]\n\t[list]\n\t\t[*]The 'ledge grab' mechanic can be inconsistent sometimes.\n\t[/list]\n\t[list]\n\t\t[*]I don't get what's the point of alcoholic beverages as items, they only give you negative effects and nothing more, might as well just remove them from game (as items).\n\t[/list]\n\t[list]\n\t\t[*]The \"children\" look like dwarves.\n\t[/list]\n\t[list]\n\t\t[*]Even though you can save your settings in Photomode, it doesn't remember it, you have to manually load your settings EVERY SINGLE TIME you take a picture.\n\t[/list]\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[h1]Summary (Phantom Liberty)[/h1]\n\t[list]\n\t\t[*]Phantom Liberty is one of the best expansions ever made. With complex and interesting characters and plot, numerous new main/side missions and gigs. And differently from the base game, it allows you to make very important choices in nearly every quest.\n\t[/list]\n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n\t[list]\n\t\t[*]Characters have very expressive facial animations, even more than the base game.\n\t[/list]\n\t[list]\n\t\t[*]I like the 'airdrop' mechanic.\n\t[/list]\n\t[list]\n\t\t[*]The main mission, side missions and gigs are all really interesting.\n\t[/list]\n\t[list]\n\t\t[*]Throughout the expansion you will have to make tough choices in the main mission, side missions and gigs. It makes up for the base game not having that many choices.\n\t[/list]\n\t[list]\n\t\t[*]The expansion has multiple endings and they are all amazing and heartbreaking.\n\t[/list]\n\t[list]\n\t\t[*]Some really amazing boss fights.\n\t[/list]\n\t[list]\n\t\t[*]Fantastic soundtrack.\n\t[/list]\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n\t[list]\n\t\t[*]Bugs.\n\t[/list]",

                "review": "[h1] 1 year of Cyberpunk 2077, The Review [/h1]\n[h3] Non-structured review, just things that come to mind [/h3]\n\n\nI bought this game on sale (29,99) exactly a year ago. I think it was version 1.5 back then. I remember seeing the teasers and trailers when they started popping up and I just thought \"I won't be able to play for a long time until I get a better PC\". Well, last year I built a new one and shortly after got the game. We all know the initial release story, so we won't get into that. Things are different now.\n\nCurrently on game version 2.02, with Phantom Liberty installed. So how has the experience been 400 hours in?\n\nThe beginning of the game felt very exciting, yet rough. The game has some pacing issues in the very beginning IMO, and sometimes the base game main story feels too short, but it actually works with the story regarding the main character's situation time-wise. After Act 1, the game fully opens up. A lot of interesting side quests, even more interesting characters (and some not so memorable ones naturally), getting lost in a good way in Night City and occasionally the Badlands. This game is great for urban exploration. You could just walk around and randomly run into situations that drag you into them. So my advice is to not use the journal or map for side quests, unless it's something you're specifically looking to do. There are these shard you find around the world on bodies and on surfaces. They usually have conversations or they are written as short books, or snippets of books. They often times explain what happened at the scene, or what was going on before disaster struck. If you pay attention to these, you will start noticing connections between some of them.\n\nYou run into people from many different backgrounds, different languages, different parts of the city actually feel unique and are recognizable once you've been there a few times. The city felt massive to me. Visually the game is very pleasing even without maxing graphics settings, so don't worry about that. The story branches out into different places and these branches will affect end-game, which I like. Definitely adds to the replayability of the game. I love the atmosphere of the city. It's stunning in the daytime and nighttime. There are news broadcasts on screens, catchy advertisements and you can hear music playing here and there when walking around.\n\n[b]The lore in the Pondsmith's Cyberpunk universe runs quite deep and it's interesting to read about. I recommend reading about things as you discover them.[/b]\n\nThe music in the game is top-notch. The score itself is something I tend to listen to all day sometimes when not playing, the radio stations have enough variety to please most people + the songs from my understanding were exclusively made by artists for the game under new names for the game. Also the band that you hear about a lot during the game has solid tracks made by a Swedish band called \"Refused\", with an amazing vocalist. Clearly CDPR are enthusiastic about music, which I am too, so +100 points for everything music in this game from me.\n\nCharacter creation is great, but has some drawbacks for me, such as limited tattoo options and personally not liking most hairstyles. Making a face for your character is satisfying. Very well modeled and good options for everything there. It lacks body type customization (as in physical build), which would've been amazing to have. You can choose between a feminine or masculine body, and you can have masculine or feminine voice on either body type, which is a nice thing to have for those who have been missing that option in other games. I want to say that the player character shadows are a bit silly, since the player model animations are horrendous, even for a first-person game. You won't be noticing that much though. \n\nIn terms of character builds, there's a decent amount of variety and options. Shotguns, handguns, machine guns, assault rifles, katanas, throwing knives, axes etc. decent arsenal for stealth gameplay. Quickhacks and netrunning is nice, but alone it's not enough for me. It's more like a supporting skill for a squishy but powerful build. Cyberware is also a good way to tailor your combat experience to your liking and needs. I just wish cyberware was more visible either directly from specific cyberware, or just a visual customization option apart from the basic head cyberware you can choose for your character. Cyberware isn't just passive abilities/buffs, some of them have major functionality to them, related to movement mostly. At the time of this review, almost everything about your character can be changed at ripperdocs, including facial features, hair, tattoos, eye color etc.\n\nVehicle choices are decent and the designs for them are great. Some clearly have an old-school vibe to them and others feel really modern and appropriate for the setting. Some vehicles are heavily modded variants of base models (mostly visual, sometimes weaponized and armored). Since update 2.0, sounds have been improved and the handling on most/all vehicles have been reworked, making some cars more driveable than before, especially on mouse and keyboard.\n\nThe recently released expansion \"Phantom Liberty\" expands not only the game world, but the story and the potential endings. It also adds more clothing and vehicle options. The newly added \"Dogtown\" feels even more extreme than what Night City is known to be. It does feel a bit separated from Night City itself, but it is run by an organization with a leader, who sets their own rules for the district. I've done one of the endings for PL and I thought it was refreshing to have a completely different one, yet at the same time it felt like they forced this type of ending into the game, which I am not going to spoil obviously. Looking forward to experiencing the rest of the endings soon.\n\nLet's talk performance and bugs. I've noticed that some things are unique to different people I've talked to. Some of it might be tied to hardware in some weird way, I'm not sure. I watched a friend play for a few hours and they had bugs I've never had myself and we talked about this. Some really seemingly basic small bugs persist in the game still which makes me think there's some extremely complicated issue making it difficult to fix everything. New bugs do pop up but I haven't had any game-breaking ones really. For most things a quicksave to quickload fixes stuff in my experience. CDPR is pushing updates and fixes actively to this day, which I respect. I'd like to know more from their side what it's like working on everything.\n\nI'm on a 1660 TI, 16 GB RAM and an AMD 5600 slightly undervolted. I am running the game at 1080p at 60fps locked, without FSR or DLSS. Runs smooth, high textures, most things on medium. Crowd density on medium. FSR gave me more stutters and issues than stability. I noticed it's better with it off, which doesn't make sense but that's how it is for me, weirdly enough. I still drop frames sometimes but mostly it's quite stable and looks great. On low to midrange hardware you have to sacrifice some things and prioritize others to make it look the best it can for you while maintaining performance.\n\nOne last thing is the photomode. I enjoy it and it's quite simple, but offers enough options to take cool shots ingame. I often use it during missions and interesting moments but I like taking photos of the environment while exploring a lot too whenever I notice myself looking at something eye-catching.\n\nI think that's it for now. Do I recommend the game? Yes. Full price though? Maybe. I'd wait for a sale due to it being a temperamental game still. It's still something worth experiencing. Give it a chance, it ain't 2020 no more!\n\nThank you CDPR, Mike Pondsmith and everyone else involved with this project. I will never forget this game, the story, the characters and the music. You pulled through the rough release and gave us an unforgettable experience and never abandoned it!",

Then combine that with easily one of the best-crafted worlds in all of gaming as your playground (Night City)!  You have a truly breathtaking experience here. I will easily be doing another play through or two eventually. \n\nIf you have not given this game a chance due to its poor launch, reconsider trying it again on a fresh save.\n",

                "review": "Well, i guess it is time to spill some of my thoughts about this game. I never was a fan of a cyberpunk setting, and the first time I've heard about Cyberpunk 2077 was back in the day in 2013, when the first teaser came out, and wasn't really excited. At that time I already knew about CDPR (thanks to the Witcher series) and their exceptional talent for making games worth of our attention. So I thought to myself: \"These guys should make something great out of it for sure.\" And what they actually did, exceeded all of my expectations. I really must point the fact, that I wasn't waiting for every post and news upon development, and actually played the Cyberpunk 2077 this year (patch 1.63) for the first time. Of course I was aware of an AWFUL lauch of this game: bugs, glitches, bad optimisation etc, so I was pretty much sceptical, but decided to give it a try. And today, I'd claim, that this was one of the best decidions I've ever made in my gaming history. I get why people was so mad and salty, but damn, this game just doesn't deserve all the hate. I think it's so fucking unfair. Dogshit games like with 0 human effort whatsoewher comes out every year (yes, Ubisoft, I'm talking about you), and doesn't get even an ounce of hate, that CDPR got. I am strongly suggest to come back to this game now, if you ever dropeed it, cause of bad lauch, memes and so on.\n\nThe gameplay, graphics, music, characters, story. I love absolutely ALL about this game. Some games just have a SOUL, and if you drop all your shit, and give it a second chance, you'd understand what I'm talking about. BRAVO to the developers. I've bought this game twice (GOG and Steam), and i really hope that my little effort will help CDPR keep enough motivation to make more projects like thisone. 10/10",

The new progression is much more in line with what it should have been, and the most egregious bugs/show stoppers have been fixed.\n\nThe storyline was always p. great, but it was made difficult to enjoy through the large amount of jank surrounding it, and this is no longer the case.\n\nI genuinely like the game, at this point. Very little compares to strolling down Night City and having adventrues in it.",

The game feels one of a kind, and I think it's because it is.  \nIt's ambitious and it mostly manages to meet if not exceed your expectations.  \nIf I'm being nitpicky, the part that I disliked was the fact that the game has multiple endings.  \nI played through two of the possible endings and neither managed to provide a satisfying ending to the game, at least for me. They both felt bittersweet, maybe that's what the devs intended idk.  \nI understand why multiple endings exist, I just wish it had a more linear story.  \nThen again, I would probably never pick it up again if that was the case. And I definitely plan to start a new game soon.  \nAs far as graphics go, Path Tracing is amazing as a tech preview and I can't wait for it to become more common in newer titles.  \nThe game had a rough start, but the fact that CDPR managed to turn it around is impressive.  \nDefinitely worth a playthrough (or multiple).",

                "review": "Disclaimer - I have only played Cyberpunk after patch 2.0, so I have no idea how the game looked or played before that. \n\nAs a Bethesda fan, the best recommendation I can give is that this game fulfills and scratches 85% of the same niches and itches that Bethesda games usually do. And for the ones that it does, it does it much, much better, with far greater polish.\n\nEnvironmental storytelling and accidentally stumbling upon interesting stuff is the thing I personally love most about Bethesda games. I would say Cyberpunk does it almost as good, but often it actually feels better because of the superior movement options and amazing city design.\n\nThe city is unlike anything I have ever seen in a game before. It genuinely feels like a city, towering over all of its inhabitants. Sure, the NPCs are mostly mindless, identity-less puppets, but realistically, it's not possible to do it any other way. Compared to Bethesda cities... it's just absolutely amazing in every way. \n\nThe story and writing are great. Surprisingly, even though the game is very open, it can occasionally be incredibly cinematic. The characters are very expressive during dialogue, often even if they're not the ones speaking. It's truly remarkable how much can be conveyed through subtle head shakes or grins in the background. \nHowever, it has to be said that your protagonist is not a blank slate. You have a lot of options on how to act in every situation, but V has a certain... attitude that you can't really change. I like it, but it might not resonate with everyone.\n\nThe gameplay, at least after patch 2.0, is in my opinion the best in any open world game ever. The builds you can craft have very diverse playstyles, and they genuinely feel unique. You can approach pretty much every missions guns blazing (which is just a lot of gory fun) or stealthily, which to my surprise feels a LOT like Deus Ex.\nIn some ways, the combat reminds me of Overwatch. Playing with a revolver feels a bit like McCree, katana gameplay has some similarities to Genji, while Gorilla Arms (my personal favourite) are a lot like playing Doomfist. \n\nI don't really need hyper-realistic graphics in my games, but it has to be said that with a beefy enough PC no other game comes close in the looks department. \n\nAll in all, Cyberpunk dethroned Skyrim as my favourite open world game, and I'm kind of sad no more DLC is planned for it. \nOh, BTW, the DLC shows that they learned a lot and is basically the same great game with 110% of the quality.",

Its everything I'd hoped it would be and more. The dystopian future painted by this game is very engaging, and I'm not typically an RPG fan - I do like GTA5, Red Dead 2 and this struck a similar nerve for me. I was kind of \"meh\" on Fallout4 but found parts of it fun. This combines the best of all those and breaks new ground as well. Its also sports some of the best graphics I've seen yet which just helps make it more engaging to me. Excellence all around - Single player at its finest.",

                "review": "An RPG that brilliantly captures the sinister futuristic and dark atmosphere of a cyberpunk future. With all the weirdo's, technological marvels and dirty dark secrets that are best kept in the dark. After the 2.0 update this game is now truly near perfect. There aren't many first person RPG's with a scope this large that can deliver such a constant high production quality \"cutscenes\". Because they arent really cutscenes, they're ingame story driven narrative, and in most cases depend on player choice and input. Even the sidequests are fleshed out and truly add to the story. You really feel like in a cyberpunk movie with freedom of movement/choice. So are there any negatives?\n\nWell, first off, normal is easy so hard is the way the go, and even then, with specs in the right place, a good cyberware selection and endgame weapons it still is a breeze later on. But guess that's just the reward for progressing. \n\nFurthermore I still found an occasional bug/glitch. But with a playtime of 140+ hours it can be counted on one hand though. Which is a huge improvement compared to the early release.\n\nThe driving still is terrible, I play sim racers and I don't expect it to be like that, but at least make it feel \"believable\". The bikes steer like a car and the cars handle like floor mops. Most of the time I just prefer to just airdash and double jump around town to avoid this nasty mechanic. But sometimes it can be chill to cruise around blasting techno. Cars themselves are nicely detailed and unique in appearance. Cyberpunk styled with detailed interiors. Too bad they just aren't as fun to swing around the corners compared to some other open world city games.\n\nI rarely pick up a game twice, but when i do, it usually goes straight to my favorites. So thats exactly what I did when I went through it again but with improved 2.0 mechanics and a fine DLC. CDPR, you've rocked my world yet again after the witcher. Bravo!",

Also the game has very good voice acting and the male V is voiced by one of my favorite audio book readers MacLeod Andrews.",

After they announced Phantom Liberty I decided to give it another try and this game is *SO* much fun now, I powered through the main story first, fell in love with the story and the characters, the side quests have that alluring flair that keeps you busy, and the main story is incredible. Then I started playing Phantom Liberty and I have to say, they pulled another blood and wine, this expansion (and 2.0 update) are incredible, very worth the time, money, and effort. Absolutely recommended. With AMDs new frame generation feature my rx 6700xt can pull upwards of 120fps on ultra settings with full ray tracing up to ultra.",

The gameplay is super fun, and you have the freedom to approach a lot of missions however you want. There are a lot of really cool character builds, which allow for tons of different way to play the game. NC is masterfully designed, and it feels very immersive especially at night. Cyberpunk's main storyline is very interesting, and I had a great time with side quests as well.",

As for the gameplay it's for sure better than on release but there are still bugs however those are really unimportant and not impacting gameplay. Just props and NPCs in cutscenes clipping into stuff but those are common issues that are present in many singleplayer games. Overall I would say if you have the PC to run this game and want to play one of the story games in history just buy it. Personally no game/tv show/movie/anime never came close to how I felt during and after playing this game.",

The futuristic style, captivating characters, great voice acting, and engaging storyline make it one of the best games I've played.\n\nThe game's look and feel are amazing, taking you to the dazzling but dangerous Night City. The characters are interesting, especially the main character V, and the voice acting is superb, especially Keanu Reeves. The story is deep and full of choices that matter, so you can play it multiple times.\n\nIn short, Cyberpunk 2077 is a game you shouldn't miss. It's a memorable experience you'll treasure for a long time.",

В итоге просто забыл про игру . Вспомнил про нее только после выхода патча 2.0 . Поиграл и ... да баги были , но не так много и не критичные . Зато геймлпей + сюжет это просто потрясающе . Не знаю как там было до патча но мне лично в боевке понравилось все , выбор своего стиля боя , подбор определенных имплантов и даже крафтинг . \nЭх а эти концовки ... Игру я скорее всего перепройду , может даже и не раз",

This game is buggier than a beehive and the combat sucks the dongfish's nutte sac. I just got the big fat shotgun and dash double jump at everything over and over again. Even on very hard the game is baby easy. Also melee combat feels like I'm fighting with 300 ping. BUT the city itself is pretty cool and I liked the \"bad\" ending. Some of the quests were pretty cool too.\n\nOverall I give this game a 7.5/10. If it was either bug free and the combat was not doggy doo doo or filled with even more funny bugs, it would probably upgrade to a 8.5/10.",

                "review": "Finally, the prodigy son returns with a 2.0 update. Having played this at release on both PC and PS4, it's safe to say that it was one of the worst releases ever (Yes even worse than No Man's Sky because this is CDPR we're talking about). Being one of their \"fan boys\", I obviously grew up playing the Witcher games extensively. I still remember playing Witcher 2 as a kid thinking it was Mass Effect but the mystical/fantasy version (with BOBs and VAGENES which my teenage blood HAD to say yes to). The notoriety CDPR had built around the years between 2016-2019 were unmatched after releasing The Witcher 3, one of the best to have done it. They were almost always at the top of every conversation regarding which game studio was the best. It was praise after praise, and I was amongst the many that cheered for the company as a whole.\n\nFast-forward to the end of 2020, a few weeks before the launch of the game after numerous delays. The hype was at an all time high, but wait, something's wrong... They're suddenly changing a lot of the descriptions of the game... A lot of the things that were promised don't seem to be talked about at all... Reviewers cannot show early footage of the game... I remember defending these things online, even getting into heated arguments with people whom I will never meet. \"It cannot be! We have to trust them, they haven't let us down so far!\" \n\nAnd then BAM!!! The game dropped, and my oh my, I've never looked like a bigger fool. There I was, absolutely devastated at the state of Cyberpunk PS4. The graphics were terrible, the performance was terrible, the game was buggy as all hell, and worst of all, THE GAMEPLAY WAS SUPER GENERIC! I couldn't believe they just promised 100 things just to deliver on 10 of them! I got so fed up, but being the fanboy I was, I somehow blamed it on myself. \"Must be my system\" I thought. \"My PS4 is getting old now, surely my beast PC will fair a lot better!\". What an innocent little boy, wish I could go back in time and smack on sense into him. I bought the game for a SECOND TIME on PC to try it out, because apparently \"This is the version they're very proud of\". Well who woulda guessed it, it's still absolutely dogshit on PC besides the minor performance increase. The game was the literal definition of eye candy. Sure it looked great, but at what cost? Imagine my surprise when the Playstation store started allowing refunds, I have literally never seen it happen a single time. Safe to say, I got my money back on both platforms, and kissed the idea of having a \"favourite company\" goodbye.\n\nThat was a bit of a long rant, but it's important to understand my state of mind going into the 2.0 update. Here we are, 3 years later. There have been so many patches for the game, most people would say it's a whole new game entirely. Well is it? Have the graphics improved? Is the performance better? What about the gameplay, how's the combat? Well, obviously with 3 more years to bake in the oven, the game has turned out to be quite decent. It runs quite well now, but I've also had an upgrade on my rig since then. It looks better too, but maybe that's just the PTSD from looking at the PS4 version so much. The combat though, is one thing that has improved immensely. They have added so many new perks and upgrades to combat that the amount of options you have is almost over-whelming! You can now also buy new apartments and locations, as promised originally, and you're also able to shoot out of your car if the police were to chase you, which for some reason DIDN'T EXIST IN THE ORIGINAL RELEASE!???\n\nBut here are my gripes with the game... Even though there's been all these improvements years later, you can still tell that the game was rushed AS A WHOLE. The foundation just doesn't feel like it's fully there yet. I mean what is the point of getting new apartments when the main storyline is so short and the best apartment is locked until the end of the game!? It feels like they didn't fully hit every plot point they needed to. I remember trying my best to avoid the main story, opting to go for side missions and one time gigs, but I somehow shot through the story like a bullet. I never really got the chance to sit and marinade with most characters and plot-lines before they're written off the story or just written off to become basically nameless NPCs. I was genuinely surprised when I got to \"the point of no return\". It felt WAYYY TOO early for that. I haven't even fully lived in the world yet. I remember in Witcher 3, when you reach \"the point of no return\", it genuinely felt like \"Wow... What a journey we had to get here. All the people I've met in the game, I sure hope I'll live right by them\". You do not get that feeling here, at all. Hell, I didn't really feel anything with Johnny by the end, who is the character you're supposed to connect to the most since he LITERALLY lives in your brain! The game is like a fling you have with someone. It was fun while it lasted, but you're not satisfied emotionally. Both of you never really had the chance to know about each other and they're just gone by the next morning.\n\nIf you're looking for something to excite you and hit that adrenaline rush when you slow down time and take down all enemies in a blink of an eye, or maybe slice someone up with a Katana when you activate your Berserk, then sure, this game will deliver on that. But if you're looking to emotionally connect to the story, hoping to get lost in the world that was so beautifully crafted with deep and well-written characters, or maybe just be able to fully immerse yourself as the main character who lives as a small entity in an ever-changing sea of people, then sadly this game won't be able to deliver that, not even close in my opinion. The eye-candy effect is still there, where it is so pretty to look at, but too shallow to do anything with. This is something I'm hoping they can improve with the sequel, and maybe take some notes from the amazing Anime! I still recommend trying the game out though.",

The high point is really the story and the few characters that stick with you for a good while like: Johnny, Jackie, Judy, Panem, Victor, Kerry, River, Takamura, Us cracks and Misty. While also having very strong characters you barely meet like Jackies mom. I cried several times during the main story and side stories. The new dlc is also really good, with the high point being the new gig with the corrupt cops and Songbird. My only gripe rn is that I personally don't like any of the endings. I think they're good and fits the theme, but in a weird way I love this f*cked up city and these fantastic characters, and I never want their story to end. At least my favorite gonks will be legends in the Afterlife when they flatline. \nI wish the developers my thanks, and hope that anyone that plays it has a great time",

With a 5800X and 3060ti and most settings set to ultra (RTX off, DLSS balanced) I'm getting between 60-80 fps. I'm about 40 hours into a new Phantom Liberty save and probably 1/3 of the way through - it is a TON of new content. Beautiful game, unique gameplay, incredible and vibrant city and desert environment.",

As a testament to how much I enjoyed it, I immediately bought and completed the Phantom Liberty expansion after finishing the base game.\n\nIn its current state in 2023, Cyberpunk 2077 is a masterpiece and I can fully recommend this to anyone who would like to experience one of the best single-player video games available today.",

I fell in love in a plot, in characters, in quests, in story writing, in world presented, in graphics, but not the performance. Even though I've played on Ultra RTX ON, even after 2.01 update I sometimes get some performace low spikes, nevertheless the game looks beautiful even in those 40/50FPS. I was stunned, but I can see the point of some performance freaks that it's not running smoothly. I was there for a ride that includes in most part the plot and roleplaying of this RPG, and those parts (even if at some time are hard to uderstand and have a lot of layers to unwrap) the game is perfect. I had highs and lows, laughs and cries, depression and dopamine hits and with DLC (unfortunately the only one there will be which I despise, but somewhat uderstand ehh) which introduces whole another level of depth to the game I can just play and play just to live anoder dusk in Night City. My personal favorite and that's why I'm easy about performace issues and bugs which did not ruin my gameplay but could be annoying at times - the story and everything else boost it up to 10/10 especially for someone who is looking to dive reeaaaaaaly deep into dytopian future world and your part in it as a desperate person (talking about main characcter)",

                "review": "Love this game. Loved it when it was a buggy mess, love it even more now. One of my top 10. It's what I wanted Skyrim to do in terms of weaving cutscenes into dialogue into narrative and back into gameplay almost seamlessly.\n\nI love how some conversations in the quests with characters are just sitting and having a conversation about life and death. Takemura conversations in the early morning talking about growing up under the thumb of a megacorporation on a stakeout, rooftop conversations about what to do after you lose a loved one, etc.\n\nThe game let's it's narrative and interactions breathe, but then it also let's the story have crazy set pieces as well.\n\nOBVIOUSLY the launch was bad, blah blah blah, but the bones were there, and the team did what they could under an unrealistic production timeline etc. So to see them stick with it and bring it to where they intended it to be has been great.\n\nI think with things like Cyberpunk and Battlefield I'm hoping the industry starts to get enough data to fight back against bad high level decisions.\n\nI also love the idea that CDPR is going to start using an engine instead of building one from scratch, Unreal will probably really accelerate their goals and I can only hope that the next games they release learn from the trials and tribulations of this release.\n\nAnyway... play it, it's never been a better time to get into it than when it's the best it's ever been. Also go watch Edgerunners and then go find all the Edgerunner's easter eggs in the game.\n\nI love this game. And I love you. Probably.",

I'm talking about the updates, baby!\n\n🌟 Graphics - They've buffed it up like a bodybuilder on a protein shake binge. Night City shines like a neon dream. The streets look so real; you could almost feel the rain. It's like a futuristic postcard come to life. As a fan of the original tabletop game, I am glad it's represented like this by CDPR ! :D\n\n🕹️ Gameplay - It's smoother than butter on a hot skillet. No more bizarre physics experiments; now it's like controlling a supercharged sports car. Those gunfights are exhilarating, and the hacking feels like a digital wizard's wet dream.\n\n🤖 NPCs - They've finally graduated from the school of broken AI. No more T-posing, no more disappearing acts. The folks in Night City are now real people (in a virtual sense, of course), with routines, emotions, and the occasional attitude problem.\n\n🐞 Bugs - Remember the swarms of bugs? They're mostly gone, or at least you won't find them crawling up your screen. The game is stable now, so no more hilarious, unexpected surprises.\n\n💼 Quests - The quests are more engaging than a Shakespearean drama. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll wonder if V has a death wish. The characters are so well-crafted, you'll think you're chatting with real people, albeit a bit crazier.\n\nKudos to the developers! They've been working tirelessly, like a dog chasing its tail, to bring Cyberpunk 2077 back from the brink. It's still not flawless, but it's my fav game now.\n\nSo, if you've been hiding in a digital cave waiting for the right moment to dive into Night City, now's the time. This game's had more facelifts than a Hollywood superstar, and it's finally ready for its close-up.\n",

It's hard to pinpoint, but it's really an experience like no other game I've played.\nIt has its flaws, for sure, but it's a game deserved to be played by any one that loves gaming.\n\nI also was not on the hype train before it came out, and I waited one year before purchasing it, so I wasn't disappointed by anything, and I started playing expecting less than what I got, so maybe that's a factor too.",

I jumped on steam and purchased it. I've played it on and off for a while. Hence why I'm only reviewing it now.\nGame play 10/10\nGraphics again 10/10\nStorywise 6/10 saying that as there is far to much blabbering on the missions. Would be better if there wasn't so much talking.\nThat's the only negative thing I can actually say about this game.",

Don't even get me started on Phantom Liberty, took an already amazing game and turned it to 11. I can't get enough.",

If you like Starfield, you will definitely love Cyberpunk\n\nVoices acting is very well done.\nMocap also is very good\nThe dialog is well written\nand very fluid exploration, with very minimal loading screens.",

I consider it the best RPG, story game I've ever played. If you got the game when it was released and were disappointed, please give it another try. It is worth every 'enny' you've got. \n\nMy only disappointment now is that they are not making more \"DLC's\" or expansions. I want more!

Game gets easy very quickly if you start completing alternate content.  Each upgrade is incremental but by the time you're putting t5+ gear on you should be a walking terminator.  I usually don't like games with high difficulty, but played this game on hard, but I play \"clear the map of icons!\" and thus outleveled content drastically.  Possible it has to do with build, I was a netrunner which late game can just silently collapse enemies from a distance then walk up and loot after everything is dead.  Highly recommend.",

What I can say is this game is pretty damn good. It's a nice open world ARPG/FPS that feels like the perfect mix of a GTA game and a Deus Ex game. The one critique I have is that I just really don't enjoy \"guided/played cutscenes\". I just don't like them in any game. Give me the exposition in a short cutscene video and let me get back to playing. I'm a busy man with little time to play and when I get that time I want to play, not act in a scene.",

The art direction was always incredible in this game, but nothing brings out the full neon glory Night City like full path tracing. The tech behind it is black magic and I love it. And even if you can't run it with RT Overdrive, the game is still stunning at more reasonable settings.\n\nThe core combat has also been really fun to dig into since the 2.0 update. The overhauled combat is highly dynamic when you start really digging into a particular build. I went in thinking I wanted to be a netrunner that throws knives and there was a clear path towards making that build not only possible, but downright effective at the highest difficulty. The amount of fun I've had running my build makes me all the more excited to eventually try out alternative builds as well. Maybe I'll ditch my cyberdeck entirely and go for a revolver/katana build. Or maybe I'll stick with the netrunning and lean into smart weapons. Or maybe I'll just be a hammer wielding behemoth. The enemies got harder with this update, but the new abilities that are available (particularly the movement options) make you ridiculously powerful if you learn how to use them. And even then, if mastering combat isn't you're thing, you can always become extremely powerful as a purely stealthy netrunner and still have very engaging enemy encounters.\n\nOverall really enjoying myself. I took a long time to give this game a shot but I'm really glad I did. Me and my friends are having a great time with it.",

This was on purpose: the state of the game at release was not great, and that should not be forgotten. \nBut when I finally started I was utterly amazed. The city seemed alive to me. Posters and graffiti covered the walls. Screens on the elevators blasted advertisements for fictional (and dystopic) products. Cars ran you over if you stepped on the road ignoring traffic signals. People spoke with their own lingo. On every corner I could find members of different gangs, each with their own unique characteristics. \nAfter a while, though, some of the amazement fades. The advertisements get repeated. The system of reputation with individual factions, if it exists, is very shallow. You don't interact much with the world. You see random enemies on the street, you kill them, and nothing much changes. I would expect that after killing 1000 members of a gang, they would shoot me on sight. Or flee? Call for backup? Hunt me down?\nI thought there would be options to be friendly with some of them, and get access to specific stuff. Maybe gangs would fight each other for territory. I can't help but feel that whoever originally designed this game imagined a deeper system, and that it was cut to expedite release. \n\nAs it is, I think the setting is immersive, the gameplay is a lot of fun and the story is excellent (so far; haven't finished yet). And so are many of the side missions. Characters are believable, and voice acting is very good. Just because of these things, I believe it deserves the thumbs-up.\n\nBut I can't help but wish that it had gone a bit further.",

Also made a ton of screenshots, to browse them 10 years later, like a frickin' vacation album, if I even live that long...\n\nWorth checking after 2.0 update and with Phantom Liberty installed. \n• Loving the setting, cars, music, story.\n• Both the stealth, Deus Ex-like approach, and total mayhem are valid options and can feel satisfying.\n• The new police system is nice as a background, but better don't fiddle with them too much yourself.\n• Think of it as an atmospheric looter shooter more than a deep RPG, it will help ;)\n---\nI recommend watching Edgerunners, even if you're not into anime. \n\nCons? You will still encounter some technical issues (had 7 random crashes in total) and some bugs, but nothing terrible. This is the way it should have been presented in 2020...",

Even when the game first came out i loved it although the bugs were annoying, the aesthetics of the game are just perfect in my opinion and the story was interesting to me. Now, almost 3 years later, this game is sooo much better and worth the money and i still love playing it! Just got the DLC and im pretty excited to try it out :)",

Steam says 45 hours of play time but I've been playing on console mostly so lets say 200+ hours roughly. \n\nThis game has always been an absolute blast to play and on my second play through now. Finally got a upgraded PC this time around and years later this game exceeds what I already thought was awesome to begin with. The story line is better than I remember, the character building is in-depth and thorough, the replay ability is huge even before mods to expand the experience further. Graphic detail to the entire city in every nook and cranny. Not to mention the little hints to what inspired the creators of the game sprinkled through the city. This game brings so many inspiring concepts of movies, shows, and comics into a beautiful blend of artwork. \n\nThis game (If you pay close enough attention to the underlying themes) really gives you an awesome philosophy on success at the cost of everything and everyone around you based on every decision you make through the game. Which can show you the harsh realities of your choices but also can show you how important friends and loved ones really are in your day to day life. Alternatively, it also shows you the absolutely harsh evil reality of Night City and the world around you. \n\nIf you have never played and are curious but heard so many bag things about this game over the years then let me leave you with this to think about. If you say you love games, the why listen to what everyone else says about it unless you've also given some time and effort? Have your own experiences and enjoy them for what they are. :)",

                "review": "Cyberpunk 2077, as of 2.0, is a phenomenal game. Cyberpunk is, essentially, a first-person Grand Theft Auto game set in a dystopic future. Though Night City doesn't feel quite as alive as GTA's metroplexs', what it does do is completely blows the GTA mission structure out of the water. Two key factors contribute to this:\n\n1) Missions in GTA games always start and usually end with a cutscene. Rockstar are fantastic at directing these scenes, but they definitely break up the flow of the game. And there's this disconnect where the actions characters do in cutscenes don't match the types of actions you see in the open-world. Cyberpunk's first-person narrative, on the other hand, mimics storytelling tropes from other FPS's like Half-Life 2. You're often free to walk or look around during, \"cut scenes.\" This approach also allows them to weave in-and-out-of little story-telling bits mid mission. It all amounts to make each mission feel very immersive.\n\n2) Some of the more in-depth story missions allow you to take a break in between story beats. Again, very subtle, but if you've just done a big activity that leads into another big activity, the game will split that mission in two, and allow you to roam the city for a bit before jumping back in. Not a huge deal, but this really compliments my play style.\n\nThat said, Cyberpunk's first act is a colossal mess. I absolutely hated the world presented to me, and I wasn't sure I could even enjoy this game. My first impression of Cyberpunk led me to believe that [b] in Night City conversations start with a gun in your face. [/b] It's really insane the quality of tone and writing change that takes place afterward.\n\nCyberpunk is also blatantly transphobic, and that needs to be said every time this game is mentioned. I really hope the graphic designer who made the adds in this game cringe themselves into a tiny raisin. That there is so few of them too, is just... woof. The 'edge' in Cyberpunk seems for the shit-posting-is-magic types, and that, imo, is the opposite tone a cyberpunk game should tow.\n\nCyberpunk 2077 is a game with baggage. It's the lovable hot-mess of friend you find yourself defending often. But unltimately, I do believe CDPR has pushed the open-world mission-structure into a new, brighter future. The game is front-loaded with a large amount of bafflement, but pushing through there is also a ton of small, smart changes to the formula that I hope Rockstar takes notice. But they probably won't lol.",

                "review": "Goddamn this game made a comeback. Went from being a pretty but ultimately hollow ARPG with barely any RPG mechanics with a good but kind of abruptly ending story. to easily the best looking game of its type, with a satisfying ARPG loop, good RPG elements, vastly improved combat and combat diversity, and a perfect DLC storyline. I cannot stress just how good the storyline for Phantom Liberty is, and how well it fits into the already existing framework that the main campaign provides, while offering a ton of new setpieces, encounters, characters and just pure awesome moments. There's a good variety to the endings, with a few of them being a bit of a shocker, and all the characters are memorable and iconic. The much needed update to the combat helps tremendously, making buildcrafting both essential and fun, without feeling suffocating. The ceiling is also very high for all playstyles, with a pretty high amount of specialisation possible in each playstyle to fine tune and maximize your potential. The redone police and vehicle systems(plus addition of weaponized vehicles) is fun, and adds a bit of flair that was previously missing.\n\nThe performance is also much better now, especially with DLSS, if you have it. While theb graphics were always stellar, it somehow looks even better now, and dogtown especially is just eyecandy. If you have a system capable of Path Tracing, then you step into a whole new dimension of graphical quality, with lighting so realistic that every scene looks amazing. It's incredibly intensive, but boy does it looks unreal. Not much else to say about the graphics other than industry standard setting, in every way possible.\n\nOverall, CDPR have taken a 7/10 game at launch, fixed it up, overhauled it, and with the release of Phantom Liberty, made it easily one of the best ARPG releases of the past decade. Easily in my top 3 games released this year, and would be number one if Baldur's gate 3 didn't exist. Truly amazing, easy 9.5/10.",

This is a review of 2023 vrs of Cyberpunk 2077 - Phantom LIberty\n\nThe game is amazing!\n\nNight City is beautiful and full of crazy characters. There are so many side jobs to do. So many characters to meet. You cannot get bored in this game. With the upgrades, weapons, vehicles, just makes it so that you can literally approach each scenario in whatever way you please.\nYou can sneak in and just assassinate everyone. You can control turrets to take everyone out instead. You can place viruses on people and fry their brains. You can walk in with arms full of brawn, a rocket launcher like Magaman, or slice em up. Or you can just go in guns blazing!\n\nSure of course there are bugs, and some of the missions are meh, but that doesn't take away from the full picture.\n\nThis game is fun! I know it was rubbish at launch, but it's so fun now. I hope they learn and make the second game even better with more of an in depth main story and fun side missions with less bugs.\n\nGTA on CRACK! Lets go get some Eddies Chooms!",

Yet, there are plenty of nice looking NPC's in the game, making it puzzling why there is little to no nice looking stuff for female V.",

Still has an long-winded intro though, and it takes time to really \"get\" some parts of the gameplay. But it's worth it.",

                "review": "[h1]10/10[/h1] I thought RDR2 was a tragic game. But this is possibly an even more bleak and depressing story. You could easily make DLC about most of the characters. The VA and MOCAP are insane - characters actually move around the environment and have complex animations when interacting with them. There are certain dialogue choices that you can only get if you picked a specific \"life path\" at the beginning or depending on your past interactions. There is also something like 13 different endings.\n\nGreat RPG, insane amounts of customization in terms of appearance, builds, abilities and even your apartments. There's 6 skill trees which give you different abilities to aid you in hacking or combat etc, then you also have the \"Cyberware\" and weapon upgrades - there is infinite possibilities. There is a lot of weapon variety, you have everything from blades, blunt weapons, throwing weapons, to every type of firearm. Each category of weapon has different types and each weapon has a level which can be upgraded, crafted or found in the world. There are \"iconic\" weapons which you get from certain characters or defeating bosses etc.\n\nSide missions use unique locations and in some cases are as good or better than main story ones. Some are a bit repetitive in terms of objective but the level design makes you consider different approaches depending on if you can hack your way in, use stealth or go guns blazing. The interiors are never boring, every locations had a completely different vibe.\n\nCombat is great. Whether you're using melee or mowing enemies down with a shotgun or using quickhacks to fry their brains and hack shit, it's awesome; good gore and dismemberment. You also have a good selection of grenades and a variety of health items and upgrades.\n\nThe music... THEY MADE OVER 150 TRACK SPECIFICALLY FOR THE GAME. AND ITS ACTUALLY GOOD.\n\nThe game is not without flaws but I think a game or any piece of media is more than the sum of its parts.",

But now, with Phantom Liberty and after 2.0 this game is a MUST!\n\nIf you love RPGs and single player FPS' you just can't at least try it, Now it's 9/10. \n\nThere are still minor bugs, some quests feel very janky (Panam quests), some animations in the game feel bad (the way characters in cutscenes drive cars feels terribly off), but it's nothing that we, gamers, haven't seen before in our lives (especially nowadays, when most \"AAA\" games come out half baked).",

But point is I think the games in a good spot where its crisp and new and has had many quality of life improvements. Over all I give this game a 8.5/10 will probably change once I try phantom liberty ive only heard great things of it.",

The same way Witcher 3 didn't have the best of launches but through hard work and dedication made it one of the best games of the the last decade. I think Cyberpunk is well on it's way to join Witcher 3.\n\nThe 2.0 QOL updates have really helped and allowed me to be more immersed in the game than previously. The new area and new characters fit it very well with the setting and I think allows a greater appreciation for the world built.\n\nNot the biggest of fans of the new main story ending but can understand why this was added given the way the DLC is.\n\n100% worth your time playing this game. If you can get it on a deal great but I would say now full price is well worth the choice.",

After i watched Edgerunners while being zooted off the giggle bush i thought well damn might outta give this horse a race, not like im doing nothing better but i gotta say now that they have fixed alot of the issues i couldn't recommend a better game. With a rich and long story of some poor bastard getting stuck with a narcissistic rocker with a raging hard on for Arasaka, Its a journey of one trying to find meaning and survival in the cesspool known as Night City and by god did i get my moneys worth. 10/10 but there is three major bugs still around when it comes to the story so all i gotta say is when you get a mission prompt to wait for someone to call you, dont fast travel away, call a car and drive. and when you get to chippin in (you'll know what i mean when you get there) make sure you done the side mission where you talk to a bum named stephan and buy the BD (you will also know what i mean when you get there).

DLSS is on quality mode with a sharpness of 1 and AI frame gen is also on. it leads me to get abt 40-50 FPS in Night city but in dog town i can see my frames drop down to 20-30.",

The story is what held the game for me came launch, but now that every factor feels cohesive, u can really get lost in this game (in a good way). Not to mention the DLC really steps it up a notch with the story. Honestly worth your time.",

                "review": "I love this game! I loved it so much that I bought it twice - once on my Xbox One X when version 1.6 was released, and then I preordered the Phantom Liberty bundle for Steam. It is truly a masterpiece!\n\nWhile playing on my Asus Zephyrs G14 with GTX 1650 @ 45 FPS (Medium-High Settings), I didn't encounter any game-breaking or immersion-breaking bugs, and the ones that were there were negligible. Given the density and amount of content in the game, it's unsurprising that there are some bugs, but they didn't detract from my overall experience.\n\nIt's worth noting that the experience will be different on a PS4 or Xbox One, as they are locked to update 1.6 and won't be able to run the new versions due to hardware limitations. However, this is to be expected from an 8-year-old console, and the game was extremely ambitious. CDPR management's only mistake was releasing the game as cross-generation to please a wider audience.\n\nAs a lifelong gamer, I've been caught up in life lately, but playing this game makes me feel like a kid again. Time becomes irrelevant when I play it, and I find myself playing it daily.\n\nThe open world is beautifully crafted, with good lighting effects and ambiance. The voice acting and storyline are outstanding. The game is a must-play, and it's best not to rush through it. Fully explore the surroundings and side missions, and you'll get hours of fun from this game.\n\nThe graphics are out of this world, and the developers took an intelligent approach by making the game even more immersive with Ray-tracing Overdrive. The attention to detail in the game is incredible. The interiors feel like they're lived in, and everything is designed so well. Even after playing for hours, I still find new details that amaze me.\n\nIf you haven't tried it yet, you should give it a shot. You won't regret it!",

It definitely wasn't a witcher 3 experience but it was still a pretty solid 7.5/10. The combat gets boring and way too easy once you hit like level 40. I was playing on hard but it still took like 3 maybe 4 shot to get Adam Smasher to 20%, bro was way too weak dawg.\n\ntldr: Nothing mind blowing but a solid pretty game 7.5/10",

Hearing the news of Phantom Liberty, I decided to make my return. After waiting nearly 3 years I am happy to say Cyberpunk has finally grasped my attention and has more than exceeded my expectations of improvements. I am grateful CDProjekt Red never gave up on this game and its beautifully crafted universe. I look forward to the next installment!",

I don't even use Fast Travel because I want to see the city. It is extremely detailed and well-designed.\nThe character building mechanics are great. They changed a great deal with 2.0, even though in the end, there are only three viable possible builds (of course, you can make a lot of variations of these): Melee, Ranged, Hacking.\nThe side quests are very deep and can get emotional and personnal. My only grudge is the fact that all the character development you can witness in side quests is sometimes not exploited well enough by the main storyline. I guess this is because of the sheer complexity and vastness of these side paths.\n\nAll in all a solid 9.5/10. It really is close to perfection.",

(spoiler free version if you've not played yet)  I bought it on initial release and yes, it was rough around the edges, but currently its a hell of a game.  Lots of replay-ability.  I'm on my 4th or 5th run through, having tried all 3 origin stories and several different builds, this time with the Phantom Liberty content. Keanu Reeves as Johnny Silverhand - perfect.  Idris Elba as Solomon Reed is a great fit as well.  I normally don't like 'star power' in games, but these two just meld right into the story.\n\nLong story short, IF you like the cyberpunk genre, buy this game and give it a go.",

Can't say accurately how much FPS I'm getting, as I didn't check it, but it is definitely between 50-60. Hope these info helps",

I didn't play at launch so I can't personally say how buggy it was, but I experienced minimal bugs in my first play-through, and even less now. With the 2.0 update, the only bugs I've experienced are people walking through cars and other harmless funny stuff like that. Just one actual inconvenient bug that required a few coincidences to happen, and was easy to fix.\n\nI have a solid PC with a NVIDIA 3060 ti. I had a fair bit of lag when opening the map and stuff like that. I played through most of the game just dealing with it, but after a quick YouTube tutorial on suggested graphics, I improved my FPS while also INCREASING my graphics. Game still lags when opening map and such, but gameplay is smooth.\n\nPhantom Liberty is the best expansion I have ever played, it is very fairly priced. Some of my friends thought $30 was pricey for an expansion, but I promise it is by all means worth it. Story and characters are great. A whole new section of the map has been added called DogTown. One detail I really like is the high quality gigs they have in DogTown. Each gig is like a sub-story instead of the usual \"go in here, steal this, don't get caught. Each one is very unique and some are even multi-part. Some may say that all the gigs in the game should be like this, but I disagree. Sometimes I just want some quick action and stealth fun or whatever. That is what a standard Night City Gig will give you.\n\nMy personal review for..\nOverall game now: 9.5/10. Great game if you are looking for a lot of content, great characters, great action, obsessive story and lore. Only complaint is the game could use a bit more optimization. Low end computers could not possibly enjoy the sheer graphical potential of this game, which is one of its staples.\n\nPhantom Liberty 9/10. Whole expansion is well made and feels handcrafted with passion. THE BEST INTRO to any piece of content I have ever experienced. Could not be more nuts to butts action and immersion off the bat. Only complaint is I would've liked a little more lore about the characters to be shown in-game. On that note, they did allow skipping the lore dumps for players who didn't care, which is nice to keep everyone happy. Near the end it kinda felt like we were jumping straight to the finale when there was room in the plot for another major stepping stone.\n\nFantastic game, could not recommend it any more. 90 hours on my current save and still exploring more unique, thought out side quests and stories.",

The first-person perspective works incredibly well to immerse you into each scene. The setting is fantastic and memorable--the lighting, music, and aesthetics all combine to reel you in. I've only used fast-travel a handful of times at most. I found myself just choosing to drive everywhere and listen to the game's soundtrack. The game does have some jank and rough-edges in spots, however it gave me an absorbing narrative experience with satisfying combat. I wish CD Projekt was making more DLC beyond Phantom Liberty, but I'm genuinely excited for the sequel.",

                "review": "Heard the game had a really rough time at launch and decided to wait until they patched out most of the bugs first. Picked up the game once the 2.0 patch was already released and really having a blast so far. \n\nThe devs did a good job of making the world really immersive. The quest slowly gives you an idea of how Night City operates, while the various text and messages in game tells a little bit of lore as well. The atmosphere of the city is great as well, from blaring neon signs and screens playing ads 24/7, various chromed up pedestrians roaming the city to a floating giant fish hologram for some reason?, walking around night city feels like you're really in a dystopian future\n\nThe story are pretty good, balanced between tense cinematic moments but not too much as to take away controls from you playing the game. Some of the choices that you take in the story actually have a minor effect on the future quests as well which is pretty cool.\n\nThe combat feels pretty diverse as with the help of equipable cybernetics and perk points, there are multiple builds that you could mix and match ranging from a stealthy hacker that violates your mind and steals all of your lunch money, to a time stopping, knife throwing, katana wielding lunatic that leaves behind piles of bodies (or parts) every time they entered  a building\n\nMy only complaints so far is how the side missions are way too short and too few, and the NCPD task are a little bit repetitive, the driving in the game feels like driving through a prison shower and you accidentally dropped the soap, and also you can't take people's clothes off like in Skyrim (i want what he's wearing)\n\nOverall throughout my playthrough i have yet encountered any single game breaking bug, or noticed any for that matter. Would recommend for all my Chooms",

While all the glamour of how CDPR made an epic comeback with this game is still fresh in the media, there are still some simple truths about this game. It is still a far cry from what was originally presented back in 2018-2019 to the fan-base. It is not the next generation of RPG's, hell it's barely an RPG at all.\nMuch of the world cannot be interacted with, no one night stands, and no ability to really customize your cars.\nThat being said this game is probably the best in slot action adventure game you can buy. It has a really pretty world with amazing lore, mostly well written characters, and great combat. Don't expect it to be something world shattering, it isn't. It is however a damn fine game and CDPR should be proud of what they have made.\nI know my rant about all the missing features makes it sound like I hate this game. I don't, I actually love this game. Still, I feel this game has yet to achieve its full potential, and hopefully we'll see that once in lifetime experience with the next game. For now, Cyberpunk 2077 is a 8/10 for me. Excellent game, very fun, would recommend.",

Almost to the T the definition of a \"as wide as an ocean, deep as a puddle\" as you could get. I had forgot all about it until the 2.0/PL update was making waves on the internet. This is how the game should have been released. They've fixed nearly everything that was broken. Gameplay,performance,bugs etc are all ironed out and as solid as can be. It no longer feels like an empty,boring half finished world. The main quest and side quests are amazing, seriously great writing and characters.\n\nI give it a solid 9/10 in it's current state.. There is no better time to grab and play.",

                "review": "TLDR: You get what the title advertises, with a variety of weapons and abilities wide enough to fine-tune your playstyle to an exceptional degree. Focus on that without paying too much attention to the plot and characterization, and you'll have plenty of fun. But if you really need those latter elements to be strong, get this for very cheap or not at all. You will end up frustrated at the huge amount of wasted potential.\n\nCyberpunk 2077 is truly hard to get my mind around. I barely played before 2.0, so it's not about the bug-ridden farce this game apparently was at launch. Some problems linger, but I was able to work around all of them. What I'm referring to is the baffling disconnect between the painstakingly R-rated setting -- a city openly ruled by corporate and gangster warlords, suffused at all times with sexuality, bloodshed, and exploitation -- and the decidedly PG characters and storytelling. The main character, known only as V (even the name essentially a blank slate, and one you can customize cosmetically right down to genitalia and pubic hair color / style) can never more than flirt with ruthlessness, and neither can anyone in his inner circle. Virtually *every* important character not explicitly a villain somehow has a heart of gold, or at least a personal code of honor, making immersion in what is supposed to be a Hobbesian nightmare all but impossible. The reason why I couldn't keep my first playthrough going was not glitches, but the squeamishness and/or disgust V and his ex-banger best friend Jackie would express over crimes that seemed as common in Night City as farting. Sure, you can run over pedestrians, steal random cars, and shoot it out with the cops in the open world, but in the scenes that really count, V and his people are always trying to do the Right Thing, or at least do the wrong thing the Right Way.\n\nSecond time was the charm, as I went in determined to treat it as mindless fun. The reward is strong, pulpy action, a surprisingly compelling plot twist at the end of the first act, and some interesting ideas, or at least outlines of ideas, related to the co-evolution of humanity and its increasingly reality-bending technology, particularly AI. Even the side jobs (as distinguished from gigs, a different kind of side mission that are essentially small practice grounds to develop your playstyle for the story quests) furnish some honestly delightful moments of imagination and quirkiness. There was plenty of meat on the bone here for more than a good futuristic shoot-em-up. But scene after scene, development after development is marred by the dull, impossibly *nice* characters. If you're in or around your teens, you'll revel in the gore and nudity while being at least subconsciously comforted by the seeming fact that even in techno-warlord hell, the vast majority of people are good deep-down, and will triumph over evil if they only band together and try hard. If you're somewhat older, you'll wonder what possessed the writers and developers to invest so much effort in building a sprawling, multilayered hellscape overflowing with adult content only to slap the player awake at any moment when they might actually become immersed. And despite reviews to the contrary, the Phantom Liberty story is no different (its gig missions are at least significantly meatier than those of the main game). \n\nOverall, Cyberpunk 2077 does too many things well for me not to give a thumbs-up, but numerous bug fixes and revamped ability trees notwithstanding, it's not nearly as grown-up as it pretends to be.\n\nP.S. This is probably going to be highly personal to me, but I found the male V's voice to be borderline intolerable. It sounds like someone really *trying* to do a character who is earnestly described in the script as \"hip.\" Just nails-on-a-chalkboard a lot of times. I'd search for other work the actor has done to see if he talks that way all the time, but I can't face the prospect of having to listen to any more.",

The base game itself is good, but there were only so many meaty quests. I poured 75 hours in the base game and 45 in 2.0 + Phantom Liberty. All in one save. Some bugs still exist, though. As I said, since I've had only one save from the start, it seems even the 2.0 update couldn't keep it from accumulating some bugs. The more I played, the more frequently bugs and crashes happened. I hope this doesn't happen for new saves. Anyway, the game is great. I can finally recommend it.",

I even made the switch from console gaming to PC gaming because of Cyberpunk, despite wanting to as a GTA V player since launch but never enough to warrant the scratch. In short, great game if you like tech and open world RPGs, more driving focus as of late and very fun driving physics since 2.0!",

This game is incredibly immersive with interesting characters and an amazing world that's packed with details and fun things for you to do. Driving and the vehicles you can purchase are pretty cool and the perk/skill tree goes very in depth to allow for some crazy fun builds, pair that with all the fun and iconic weapons and you'll find yourself in love with combat. All in all this is an incredible open world RPG game and I recommend it to everyone.",

The amount of character development shown through both the base game and Phantom Liberty is fantastic. \n\nI didn't like Keanu Reeves as Johnny Silverhand initially, but that changed as I kept getting more into the story. He nails it.\n\nThis game has some of the best first person gameplay I have seen. Soundtrack was top notch, and visuals were beyond gorgeous. \n\nThere were a couple bugs, nothing game breaking that couldn't be fixed when looked up on Google.\n\nCDPR if you're reading this, please set a volume slider for all radios and televisions. They were beyond abnoxious, and ruined the atmosphere when doing quests or when in combat.\n\nI can't wait for the sequel. Hopefully CDPR doesn't botch the launch.",

The game looks amazing, has good performance, the bugs are limited to a minimum, mostly silly ones too, and the gameplay is finally balanced with every build having a unique flow to it. It can finally deliver the amazing story and world that was hiding behind the pile of garbage on release. I can at last write the positive review I wanted to give it all along.\nBuckle up and enjoy the ride choom!\n\nP.S. Might want to watch the edgerunners anime too before playing ;)",

I've only gone through one of the ending of this DLC and I loved it, even makes me scared and impatient to get through the others cause of the emotions those can convey. this might sound like some sellout talk but seriously this game and DLC are awesome.\n\nI mean enven the end credits for the DLC are super cool and stylised like a James Bond movie. \n\nCan't recommend this game enough and would even encourage you to get mods for this games but nothing game breaking, just a few new cars and clothes, the essentials to help you immerse yourself more in this game.\n\nthanks CDPR",

This is the game we we were gonna have from the start if not for CDPR's upper management and investors pushing for a payout. On top of that Phantom Liberty is an awesome DLC, and it breaks my heart that we won't get the 2 other DLC expansions we were originally promised. All because of the devs having to fix a game that wasn't really ready for release in the first place. \n\nIf you're thinking of getting this game, I can't express enough how much I truly recommend it.\n\nTo the Cyberpunk '77 devs: Thank you for an amazing game, game of the decade in my eyes. I wish you had been able to put out the game you envisioned from the start. I pray there is a sequel and that you're allowed to do it right, because the little details in this game show how much you all truly cared.",

Sucks a bit that after level 50 you can't switch up your perks, would have really loved to get fully decked out. But still, it's very fun to roleplay as a corpo-ninja-assasin in all black.

                "review": "Bought this game on sale last Christmas. Played roughly 3 hours, found the dialogue cheesy, the game just didn't click. Fast forward to 2.0 and I gave it another go. My word, I have not been sucked into a game like this in a long time. The world is so engaging, the RPG systems are fantastic, the characters are believable and endearing, the driving is pretty good and the 'busy' work is also better than most games. I've rarely used the fast travel as I enjoy navigating the city that much. In the time I have been playing I have yet to touch the DLC and/or finish the main campaign. I cannot really comment on the game prior to its 2.0 makeover but all in all this is a masterpiece and I got the base game for £25. If companies want to release poor products at launch and spend time working on them, I will happily wait two years, buy on discount and have a wonderful time.",

Still, it didn't live up to the hype or initial trailers we saw at E3, such as cutting out the third person cutscenes but the game is still pretty darn good. I finished the main story a year ago, came back to it when it with Phantom Liberty. It's good to experience it again for the second time and see what vast improvements were made.",

                "review": "First time I played this game was on its original release in 2020 on the Xbox Series X. The game then was buggy for sure and had its downsides like locking me out of stuff here and there but never really did me any wrong at all...\n\nFast forward a couple years... I got a Pc to run it pretty well. As well as the launch of 2.0 and Phantom Liberty expansion managed to pull me back one time (Not discounting Edgerunners lol) and here are my overall thoughts...\n\nThis games story, world, characters, and gameplay is something  I will forever cherish in my 213 hours of playtime and you should too if you manage to pick this game up. \n\nThe Story grips you from the first moments letting you set the stage for the type of past you want and keeps that going up to the gripping conclusion of the prologue, end, and DLC ending(s). It proceeds to throw you into a World of corrupt Corporations, gang violence, and the overall feel of a future with so much mystery it drives you wild. The atmosphere makes you feel like you are alive in a big city with much to explore you wont know what to do. With wacky gigs and side quests that will have you questioning life or crying in tears from laughter its just enjoyable to be apart of it all.\n\nThe characters in this story are written so well and relatable its scary tbh lol. To Keanu Reeves's rockerboy Johnny Silverhand, to the complex and stunning performance of Idris Elba as Solomon Reed from the expansion. You have plenty of great characters to get to know and romance like some of the fan favorites like Panam Palmer, a hotheaded woman from the nomad tribe in the badlands or even Judy Alvarez, a smooth and sweet gang member woman with lots of depth its crazy!\n\nThe gameplay from OG launch Cyberpunk was great and really allowed you to play in many ways. However... In 2.0 They changed everything and made each skill tree feel unique in its own way. Wanna be like David Martinez from Edgerunners? Great! They added an entire skill tree based around getting chromed up. Wanna be a Hacker like Lucy? Got that for you as well. Wanna run around with a dildo and beat people senseless? Well you can do that too! The point is that they emphasized the idea of \"Play how you wanna play\" with the 2.0 update and it makes the game feel how it was supposed to feel at launch (Even tho I liked the base game just fine)\n\nTo end this Cyberpunk 2077 is and has become one of my favorite Rpg's of 2020's and I recommend it to anyone looking for a good game that will touch you in more ways than one.\n\nP.s Wish I Could say the same about Starfield\n",

                "language": "english",
                "review": "Is the game fixed? Largely yes, but it still has problems. I have a love-hate relationship with Cyberpunk. I really wanted to enjoy it more than I did, but I just couldn't. That's not to say that I didn't have a ton of fun, because I did. The problem is that I did not have as much fun as I could have.\n\n+ The things the game did that I LOVE:\n\n- The Story: Easy to follow, very compelling and always had me wondering what was next. Every side mission also has a little story to along with it, which is much better than just side missions you normally get that tell you to go do something \"just because I told you to\". The side mission stories aren't anything crazy complicated, but they are certainly welcome.\n\n- The Characters: To be honest, I cannot imagine the characters getting any more realistic. It honestly felt like I was speaking to a real person when interacting with the characters. Each character starts off a complete stranger, but you and the characters slowly get to know each other better and, soon enough, become lifelong friends. These friendships can stretch long into the postgame, where they might give you gifts or send you messages on what they've been up to since your latest encounter.\n\n- The Music: The radio stations are packed with awesome and upbeat music, but the game isn't afraid to bring down the mood with more grim or mellow music when the the mood calls for it.\n\n-The Visuals: The game looks amazing. The entire game is just packed with little details to really make the game feel alive. Neon lit markets, run down suburbs, abandoned buildings littered with remains of former inhabitants, luxurious streets lined with shiny sidewalks. Night City really has it all. \n\n- Dialogue Choices: From main characters to vendors, you will get the option to participate in optional dialogue with almost everyone. This really helps open the world and makes it feel more real. Vendors are no longer just mindless drones there to sell you things. Some have their own little story, which is fantastic. In standard modern RPG fashion, some dialogue options can only be selected when you have a certain stat high enough. You also have to be careful with some choices, since some dialogue choices can have mild to severe consequences, or valuable rewards, either immediately or very far down the line.\n\n- The Gameplay: Standard first-person-shooter action, but with WAY more variety. Guns that charge up and turn your enemy to pulp, guns that have built-in aimbot, and a massive variety of ways to ways to crush, dismember, ignite, or blast your opponents into next week. Otherwise, you can play quietly, using hacks to mess with the minds of your prey instead. Manipulate their movements to create opening for non-lethal takedowns which may lead to greater rewards or approval from your clients as a mercenary. Use environmental objects to your advantage to give yourself an edge before the bullets even start flying, or find a secret passage that allows you to slip behind enemy lines and uphold your end of a deal without a single witness. It's all up to you.\n\n- Character Building: There are 5 main stats in the game that will define what your character is strong in. The variety isn't exactly the best I've seen, but you can tie together multiple different stat perks to create something amazing. I've seen various crazy videos of people mixing abilities unlocked from different perks, which are unlocked by having enough points in a certain stat, which can very much make you feel like a well oiled machine of death, or a ghost of a thief that gets the job done without killing a soul. \n\n+ The things the game did that I DO NOT love:\n\n- Respecing: Or the lack thereof. The maximum level in Cyberpunk is 60, which means that you can only get 3 of the 5 skills up to the maximum level of 20. Getting to level 20 in stats will allow you to take \"ultimate\" perks/abilities that can give you a huge advantage in all sorts of different gameplay situations. You can remove perk points and reallocate them as you wish, BUT YOU CAN ONLY REALLOCATE YOUR STAT POINTS A SINGLE TIME. This means that if you are weak in a stat that seems to have really cool perks to try, you may not necessarily have enough stat points in order to get the perks and abilities that you want. What happens if you use your one repec only to discover that you liked your previous build more? Either reload a past save from before you used your respec or get used to the build you got going. I'm well aware that there is a mod that allows you to respec an unlimited amount of times, but I shouldn't have to mod the game to do this. Almost every other RPG that I'm aware of allows you to respec multiple times in one way or another (Dark Souls, Borderlands, World Of Warcraft, etc.), so it baffles me this is missing.\n\n- NG+: \"What about New Game +?\" you may be asking. \"Can you play through the entire game with all of your stuff and try out a new build then?\". Nope. Cyberpunk 2077 does not have New Game +. Again, a feature that a ton of other RPGs have that is absent in this one. If there are dialogue choices that you want to see, doors that you couldn't open, or ways to tackle missions that you have never seen before, either save your game and reload the game multiple times to see all of the options or start the game from scratch. Did you make a mistake 10 hours ago that resulted in a severe unintended consequence? The only way to fix it is to reload a save from 10 hours ago, or to restart. It's a real shame, too. I played the game on Normal difficulty and found it a bit too easy, so it would be so fun to take all of my items into a higher difficulty mode and do the story all over again with tougher and more numerous enemies (or something along those lines). Additionally, some items can only be obtained by selecting certain dialogue options, so you end up doing the same thing you did before just to get the same item again.\n\n- Weapon Modding and Upgrading: Cyberpunk 2077 allows you to customize your weapons with all sort of mods and sights, most of which will have an upside and a downside. The problem comes when you realize that you cannot remove mods from a given weapon. Heck, you can't even overwrite them. Once a mod is on a weapon, it's on there FOREVER, unless it is a one-in-a-million mod that allows you to unequip it. You can also directly upgrade the stats of certain weapons. By certain, I mean the Cyberpunk 2077 equivalent to \"legendary\" weapons that are often lore significant. All other weapons, however, cannot be upgrade AT ALL. Find a cool sniper rifle that goes great with your build? You're going to outlevel it very soon and there is nothing you can do about it except hope your find another one or hope one of the vendors has one. Wait, you DID find a more powerful version of that sniper rifle that matches your level, but it has the worst possible mods on it? Too bad, go find another one. \n\n-The. Bugs. : While the game is certainly a lot more stable than it once was from what I saw, there are still some some buzzing in the air. The issue is that these bugs are the really annoying ones. Most of the bugs still present in the game are easily fixed with a \"Exit To Main Menu\", but you will be doing so more often than you should. Try to summon a vehicle and it's nowhere to be seen? Exit. Load Game. Complete a mission but the NPC you're supposed to talk to just gives you a blank stare? Exit. Load Game. Try to open your in-game journal or phone but it says \"you can't do that right now\" even though the icon tells you that you should be able to? Exit. Load Game. It gets annoying very quickly.\n\nI had a lot of fun with this game, but it still feels incomplete to me. I most definitely love more about the game than I do dislike about, but those dislikes are very bitter. I simply cannot ignore them and they really brought my experience down a peg. If you, unlike me, can accept them, then you will likely enjoy the game a lot more than I did.",

Night City doesn't care about you, about V, nor a happy ending. \n\nDo not expect the first quest with the malestorm to be how all the quests are however, only that -one- is developed so deeply. If the entire game was like that Cyberpunk 2077 would be a 9 or 9.5/10. \n\nA solid 8.5/10 compared to the unplayable launch. A little too \"On the tracks\" RPG for me to give it higher with the story choices and way too open ended on some of the endings but that's squeal bait. \n\n3080 TI, m.2 NVMD, 64gigs of RAM. \nRan ok on 1440p and on high RTX lighting with DLSS (Between 60FPS and 80 depending on location and the city density)",

It shows that Life, is roblox, and with roblox, comes McDonald's pickles. And boy do I have a history with pickles. So one time, after the events of my portal review, I was walking around the Sci-Fi Fantasy the world had decided to become after my light speed poopy fart fart travel had ended, when one day, as I'm walking with my kids who became immortal, I see a short black man in the corner of my eye, using a baseball bat as a walking stick, and my heart skips a beat. I grab my kids by the toes and run as fast as possible. \"hell naw\" i repeat to myself.\n\nBut i hear another thing. Another terrifying, spooky, dooky, thing. I hear quick footsteps, followed by a large angelic choir, but not angelic in the slightest, in fact, demonic. I turn around, praying to our lord and savior, that Kevin is not behind me. But he is. He is very behind me. He is flying, wielding a baseball bat gun, and practicing robloxian rituals. In his last words of my being conscious, he says \"You took Jake from state farm from me. You are not skibidiliscious. Prepare to cash backin'\", as he pulls the trigger, and in my last moments of this not being asleep session, I scream \"I DO HAVE SKIBIDI RIZZ!!!!!\".\n\nI wake up. McDonald's all around me, McDonald's all around me. McDonald's all around me. I see Kevin Hartenith,",

Now the game isnt perfect by anymeans when it comes to performance and gameplay but god damn was it one of the most immersive games i have everplayed! the story was enjoyable, the gunplay has greatly improved and OMG the new and improved skill tree looks like the mona lisa compared to what it once was! I've only played it once doing all the side quests and trying to do as much as i could, and im ready to hop back in. the choices you make lead to entirely different outcomes from simple quests and dialog that you would never receive if you chose something as simple as taking someones money. i have also bought the dlc and plan to run through that a couple times. being 4 hours into  new play through i already have seen a handful of things i havnt because of the choices i make! i wish there was more to do with jacky as to make that bind slightly stronger but i ended up caring about V and everyone along her path, theirs one thing this game does great and that character development and story telling. CDRP has come a long way since the initial launch of the game and im glad i gave her another go!",

                "review": "Started out pretty rough, especially for us PS4 gamers. But in the end I think CDPR has made something so very special here. Night City in and of itself is something special. Especially after the new Phantom Liberty update. Amazing job guys/gals! Just breathtaking!!! :)  I still don't like that CDPR left it up to the community to fix a lot of their issues and really think they blew it by not having flyable vehicles and making it the communities responsibility and even though the community has taken care of that flaw., I would have liked that to be a thing from the gate. I mean making a game that takes place in 2077 that has flying cars but you don't allow us to fly them is such a disappointment, and I know i'm not alone it just still leaves a bad taste in our mouths/eyes/hearts.   Hopefully Cyberpunk 2 can take things to another level. I was kind of hoping that we would be able to fly to the moon or at least a space station in Cyberpunk 2077 sooo yeah... \nAll in all they have made a pretty great game 9/10.",

And now after 2.5 years i decided to play it again because a lot of updates came out including Phantom Liberty, I must say, BIG changes in every aspect of game, i am impressed, it's like playing completely different game. And also since my first time playing Cyberpunk my PC got some upgrades and with that game feels much cooler. Not gonna lie there are still bugs happening here and there but overall not that bad like in day of release. Also I recommend to watch Anime \"Edge Runners\", its happening in same \"universe\", very cool story but really sad:((, in game you can find a lot of easter egs dedicaded to this Anime, and this is cool. Well thats all from me, i hope a lot of people will decide to play this game, it is worth every penny and every minute of gameplay.",

The world that you get to roam around in is absolutely massive, seamless, beautiful (in a way), and varied. Cool guns, character upgrades, vehicles, clothing, are all awesome. And actually, the music that they play on the various radio stations, and the TV programming etc is top notch. Now for the not so great. If I had to describe this game using only 3 words, they would be SEX, DRUGS, VIOLENCE. Why caps? Because there is a LOT of those 3 things, and they are everywhere, all the time. So, if that bothers you, be advised that you won't dig this game much. Other than those 3 things, A++. JMTC---Thanks!!",

Still some weird bugs here and there, but it is now at a level that the game should have been at or near-to during launch, in terms of stability. \n\nWriting is inconsistent. Prologue is exceptionally well written, some side quests fit perfectly into questions posed by the wider source material of Cyberpunk, others feel like the filler missions they are, and some others feel arbitrarily written to emphasize an infuriating sense of 'there's no good endings in NC', ignoring perfectly sound lore-friendly logic that would render the choices given the worst possible options. \n\nOverall, a good game. It was never going to live up to the lofty expectations set by the insane marketing, but at least now it can stand on two feet and say it's a serviceable, reasonably fun RPG. \n\nNo-brainer if on sale. Would think twice before getting at full price.",

                "review": "This is perhaps the best story-telling game I've ever played.  It's a SciFi story, well-told.  That's to say that it's deeply philosophical and asks thoughtful questions.  \n\nThere is a fair bit of adult content in this story, and V, the character you play is forced into a lifestyle of nebulous morals in order to survive.  As a result, the game has a fair amount of adult content: violence, mature sexuality, etc.  This is part of the overarching set of philosophical questions that the story asks.  If you get this game, be aware that this is what you're getting into.  As a result, I would suggest that this is a game for people who have their own firm moral compass already.\n\nI've currently played through the main story line and am a good part of the way through the expansion pack storyline.\n\nThe expansion pack storyline is enjoyable.  It adds some game mechanics that the original storyline didn't.  Most of these work well, but I had trouble with a few of them.  For example, there are a few places that require a high amount of jumping dexterity in order to progress, and the only reward is that you get to progress.  Otherwise, you die and have to redo the jump again and again until you get it right.  I'm not a fan of gratuitous acrobatics.  A few other places require a very specific count of character points in very specific categories (e.g. \"body\") in order to progress, and if you don't have enough spare character points saved up to level up V, you're stuck resetting your character points and redistributing them from scratch.  I prefer a build that is biased toward \"Intellect\" and as a result, that doesn't work nearly as well with the expansion pack content.\n\nThat said, this is still a solid game with a great storyline.  If you like this kind of game, it's worth your time.",

The side missions feel far from a waste of time, and I found it very easy to get lost in the side missions and ignore the main story. However, this is not a dig at the main story, as I thoroughly enjoyed completing each ending. I do think that it was short compared to some other triple A titles that have come out recently, including the witcher 3 main story, but this is not a drawback in this case. I think that the main story length has some benefits, as it encourages the player to create new builds and jump back into the world with new origins. Overall CD Projekt Red was able to make Night City feel more alive than other RPGs and is somewhat reminiscent of the worlds that have been created by Rockstar with titles such as gtaV and RDR2. I highly recommend this game to anyone with a gaming rig that can handle Cyberpunk 2077, and this shouldn't be too hard. I ran his game on high settings on a laptop with a 3050ti and an i5-12500H. I will definitely be checking out Phantom Liberty DLC in the future.",

                "review": "What is to say about CP2077…\n\nIt’s a well written (adult) Open World Action Adventure.\nIt’s not an RPG in my opinion.\n\nKeanu Reeves & Idris Elba are great in their Roles…\nAnd a big Shout out to the other Voice-Actors… you rock too.\n\nAll NPC are behaving like real People… the immersion can be heartbreaking… \nIf you are a Single.\n\nThe 2nd big Actor is Night City herself. Never ever has a Game Development Studio put this much effort to build a real virtual City! And be successful! Cyberpunk 2077 fulfils what Omikron: The Nomad's Soul and others have tried in the Past and failed. \nTo create a City that is a coherent, living breathing Organism.\nUntil:\nThe Traffic AI goes nuts…\nThe Pedestrians with the 2.01 Patch are a bit Brain-dead.\nThe Police starts shooting at you while “on the Job” for them.\nThe “new 2.0 Police Force” are not on par with GTA 5.  \nThen… \nYou realise that 99% of the Buildings have no meaning…\nA Potemkin Village… A Pipe Dream…\nRealise:\nThat Night City is a Piece of ART a well drawn Picture.\nNothing more!\nFrom this Point on you will use the fast travel system a lot.. \n\nBTW. On my 1st play through I spend Hours to explore Night City and the surrounding Areas…\nAnd found in quiet corners… some Quests or valuable Loot.\nBig, Big Kudos to all the Map Designers… you’re the best…\n\nSome Pro:\nThe main Meat of the Game: The Kombat is a 9/10 \nFluid & Deadly, a Power Fantasy delivered... \n\nFinally I could play as a Samurai / Pistol Build... \nThe 2.0 Perk and Ability Systems has now meaning for a Char Build.\n\nThe Phantom Liberty Gigs & Side-quests are sublime to the Vanilla 2.0 Game.  \n\nDriving a Motorbike is the way to go… because it’s not jank like driving in a Car.\n\nModding Support is a 10/10!\n\nPhantom Liberty brings new Endings…\n\nNot so good:\nSome Iconic Weapons needs certain perks to be AWESOME! Bad if you have not invested in that Ability Tree.\nBecause:\nYou can refund Perk Points but not Ability Points?! (There is a Mod for it thou..)\nIf you got for your Build, in the later stages of the Story THE Iconic Tier 5 / Plus or Plus Plus Version… you need to splatter your foes, all Lot are from this point on, are only crafting Material. \n\nThe Looter-Shooter Train stops in Midgame...\nBecause:\nOnly Iconic Weapons can be upgraded! Any other Variants are crafting Maerial.\nMods for Weapons are fixed! Once installed you cant change them. (There is a Mod for it thou..)\nThe Range of Scopes and Muzzle Attachments are very limited.\nThe LMGs were nerved and the 2.0 Patch left behind ONE Iconic LMG for the late Game\nWeapon Variety is limited... \nLast not least:\nThe AI for Traffic, Pedestrians, Police are at best a 5/10\nDriving in a Car is still mediocre.\n\nMy Experience in 100 Hours playtime::\nWith the 2.01 Patch… my Immersion with the Game was only broke two or three times, when the game engine glitches out, I had only 2 crashes in 100 Hours. That’s impressive.\n\nCP77 is a good Action Adventure!\nThe greatest Plus for CP is the Story, Johnny Silverhand and Night City! \nBut it's not on par with the Quality and Content of Witcher 3 Blood & Wine Package.\nMy personal Verdict: 8/10 – It’s a 100 Hour+ Game, Baby… \n\nMy 3rd Play-through in December 2024 will be as a female Decker / Pistol Build!. \n\nSome personal Thought: \nAfter going / ending inside the “Alien Isolation” Route in Phantom Liberty… I read up what will happen on that route… and ended the game for my Samurai / Tech / Body male V.\nAfter 100 Hours… \nI know all ending of the Vanilla Game because I played them all with the release Version on GOG.\nThe “Isolation” Route was for me on a personal Level not digestible. Your mileage, dear Reader, may vary. \n\nWhat could be better with Cyberpunk 2077 after the 2.01 Patch and DLC?\nAll Sidequests and Gigs from the Vanilla Content should be reworked to be on par with the DLC Content. AKA CP77 Blood & Wine please! Even as paid DLC!\n\nInstead of an Mercenary… why are we not entangled in a Cyberpunk “Maltese Falcon”? Just asking!\nThanks for Reading and maybe a like... hav' fun in Night City...",

                "review": "The game-world CDPR built based on the original tabletop game released in the 80's and the stories this title brings to life are just simply amazing. It really brings to life the darkness and emotions and this is partly due to seeing the world and experiencing cinematics from the first person point of view. \n\nEven though I really like the game we can not go beyond the stat it was at lunch and the state it is now. The original game lunched with a lot of problems and a lot of things that were promised were missing and never introduced in the game. Even now that the Phantom Liberty and 2.0 were released there are still a lot of problems with the game and limitations to more immersive experience, but this that might just come down to the Red engine limitations. Game experience is and does feel different with 2.0, but it is still the same game with the same strengths and a lot of the same weaknesses. \n\nPersonal highlights and shortcomings (based on my experience of the story and conversation choices). \n\nThe world and story are the biggest strength of Cyberpunk 2077 and Phantom Liberty, but they also present a lot of weaknesses. \n\nThe main base story is good, even if you do not tie in all the smaller side quests, but if you add the side quests specially the ones that affect your relationship with Johnny, other characters and the endgame outcomes the story becomes amazing, much more fulfilling and meaningful. \n\nPhantom Liberty story was even better and I really hope to see CDPR use this story and quest building approach from the expansion in all future projects. \n\nBut the way the main story is written and paced, does take away the desire or logic to explore the side quests more. I wish CDPR did a better job to tie in side quests (some are the best content in the game) with the urgency required to proceeding down the main quest line. \nAt the moment based on the main story narrative it doesn't really make any sense or logic for you to want to discover and explore the side content specially Gigs beyond curiosity, because you narrative is forcing you to ignore that side content and proceed with the goals of the main quests to achieve the main goal. They did a lot better job with this story pacing issue in Phantom Liberty, but it still slightly persists. \n(Just a reminder side quests and most of the GIG's should not be ignored as you will miss a lot of amazing content)\n\nThe world is also visually beautiful specially on more powerful PC machines. \n\nIt is also full of smaller hidden stories to discover beyond the side quests and Gigs, but this is only if you do not mind reading a lot of shard and computer messages left around the Night City.\n\nThese messages expand the Cyberpunk universe, stories and characters even further by diving deeper into lore. (I do have to admit that I only read roughly half of them as they do tend to take you out of world immersion specially during faster paced quest). \nI personally wish more of the stories from the shards and computers, would be built better around the quests not to stop the experience/immersion in the middle of action or emotional scenes just to read what is written on them so you can learn more about the situation or the world around you. \n\nThe world does however feel extremely empty if you look beyond the quests and a few side repeatable activities from which a couple are only included and introduced in the Phantom Liberty expansion. There is not much to do to bring the RPG experience and the life in Night City to life. Since the logic of narrative for the main story does not really give you time to want to explore more and waste time beyond the available quests, it would still be nice if there were other activities you could do in Night City. \n\nCombat is fun even more since 2.0 and introduction of new skill trees but it still has a lot of limitations. I tried all styles and some are more fun then others, but it all comes down to what you prefer. \n\nThe game gives you option to play the way you want and combine different play styles together with different weapons, skills and powers (based on implants).\n\nOn the hardest difficulty It does force you to go hard on implants and chose certain play styles over others to be able to defeat certain bosses and groups of enemies specially later in the game. \nDue to how they are balanced and the nature of skills, weapons and implants, certain play styles are much weaker and harder to play while certain ones are extremely easy. \nI personally enjoyed type of play behind the cover AR or Handgun shooter with minimum cybernetic implants, no hacks, no slowing down the time or going berserk, but the game is mostly focused on fast and mobile combat experience specially with bosses and bigger groups of enemies so I and players like me have to make a few changes and compromises to the way they play if you want to beat the game. \n\nI would prefer there was an option to keep your humanity side by using less implants and get other benefits with skills or story or something in return, and still make the content more difficult to beat, but allow you to have much better balance and additional content if you went down that path. Also wish there were more fishers for melee weapons and also finishers for net-running and specially gun weapons. \n\nCrafting and upgrading gear has a lot of problems even now after there were a few good fixes introduced in 1.6 and 2.0. There is a lot of customisation available in the game, but at the same time there is a lot missing and a lot could have been done differently or better (weapons colours, mods, upgrades, car upgrades and customisation, clothing has problems even now in 2.0 etc). Also vendors and the items they sell were improved, but it still misses that proper immersion based on what they can do and what they stock. \n\nOverall I would really recommend the game just based on the story and the world you get to experience and explore. At the same time I do hope that CDPR learned from their mistakes while making and releasing this game and I do really hope the next project set in Cyberpunk 2077 universe will be even better if not the the best gaming experience to date.",

It was good, but it didn't live up to CDPR's hype, and with the dishonesty from the company and even worse response to the controversy, it kinda soured the experience for me. I picked up Phantom Liberty when 2.0 came out and started a new play through at the recommendation of some reviewers that I like, and I'm very glad that I did. The game plays great, the world feels more full and alive, there is more to do and experience now, and I am impressed with the game in its current state. I really wish that the game had launched in its 2.0 state, and I would still knock points off for all of the stuff I mentioned at the start, but I would still recommend this game to anyone that likes sandbox shooters or RPGs. Also my personal recommendation is to play as female V and romance Judy. This is the way.",

I enjoyed it anyway, the story was amazing gunplay was fun but not too much ballanced such as gameplay systems. I came back to the game after release of 2.0 Patch i also bought expansion and holy moly, it is amazing, reworked gameplay systems are great, skill tree is really fun with build crafting. Combat feels really ballanced and fun (i play on very hard). I have no complains. Breathtaking",

The combat mechanics were generally well-received, with a wide range of weapons and cyberware options. The RPG aspect was also praised for its character customization and storytelling choices. 9/10\n\nStory: The game's story, set in a dystopian future, was a highlight for many players. The narrative, characters, and quests were engaging and contributed to the overall immersive experience. Choices made throughout the game impacted the story's outcome, adding to its replayability. 7/10\n\nPerformance: On high-end PCs, Cyberpunk 2077 could deliver a stunning visual experience. However, many players experienced performance issues, particularly on mid-range or older systems. CD Projekt Red promised updates and patches to address these problems & does made it even better with times. 9/10\n\n\n\n",

Their unwavering commitment to refining and enhancing the game has made it an absolute gem.\n\n\"Cyberpunk 2077\" offers a sprawling, futuristic open world that's a delight to explore. Its rich storytelling, complex characters, and the sheer attention to detail in its world-building make it an unforgettable experience for any player. The game's cyberpunk aesthetic is a visual and auditory feast, drawing players into a dystopian future with a striking mix of technology and atmosphere. It's a testament to the developers' dedication that they've not only fixed the initial quirks but have also expanded and improved upon the game, creating an even more immersive and engaging experience for all who venture into Night City.",

I do have to say that CP 2077 stays very true to the literature and original ttrpg, which is a rarity nowadays... what with \"woke\" remakes of classic genre powerhouses that ALWAYS tank at the box office.  You'd think that Hollywood and other production \"Meccas\" would finally wise up to their \"no win scenario\".  I will say that with the predicted technology in this game, true gender swapping is available.  Nanite remapping of your DNA? Its here in this game.  Nanobot reshapping/rescuplturing of your body from one gender to another? Its here.  Ahhhh, but how much will cost you? In \"eddies\" and what makes you...... well,  you.  Your soul.  But wait, you can even preserve your soul, with the tech in this game.  Think about that.  True digital immortality.  But the cost.... who'd pay for it? Anyone with the \"eddies\".... that's who.  Would anyone kill for it?.... That's the question your character answers..... in dozens of different ways.  \nGet ready for a ride.... in NC City.",

This game is very unique and very fun to play, minus the \"sex\" aspects.\nAI is very glitchy at times, you would of thought this refinement would have been completed with the 2.0 update... nope. The final boss froze in the air for me. Making him SUPER easy to defeat LOL\n\n2.0 Update has made this game MUCH more appealing and it feels much much more complete, just a few more kinks to rub out!\n\nOverall, the story had me hooked, still does.\nPhantom Liberty WILL be purchased!",

                "review": "Let's keep it real simple.\n\nAt launch, this game was a heaping pile of scop. It was buggy and broken. Now, bugs don't really indicate how bad a game is. Most games have bugs in them. It's the sheer fact that the game was broken BECAUSE it was so buggy.\n\nHowever, like No Mans Sky, CDPR dug their heels in and have continuously patched and fixed games in a number of different iterations. The most recent rework being one of the most significant leaps for the game.\n\nEverything about the game feels great. The progression system is amazing. Gameplay feels smooth and can be tailored exactly to the experience you want. The story has always been marvellous. The game is so lore dense it's insane. I have found myself spending hours outside the game to just fully grasp the world of Cyberpunk. There's real impact to a very large amount of decisions you make. If you go balls to the wall guns blazing, you are at high risk of missing unique interactions or solving the issue for a favourable outcome. The game has invoked such visceral emotions on more than one occasion from me. The characters feel REAL. From Facial expression changes to body language and even just how they speak and their mannerisms. Night City used to feel like a painting, but when you slow it down and take it in, it really does feel a fair bit more immersive. Alive even. So many different easter eggs, story lines, interactions etc. Take your pick.\n\nPerformance wise, the game does suffer from pretty hard memory leaks. I am running a 5800X3D, a 3060ti and 32GB of RAM. Alongside the game being installed on a Gen 4 980Pro. Even with all that, I am able to crank the game to high settings with RT on and DLSS helping me keep my frames above 60fps. A good bit of advice is to clear your in-game inventory of stuff you don't need (Weapons, clothes etc). I have found it helped quite a lot when my frames were getting choppy. \n\nI can't deny the game didn't deliver on it's promises in NOV 2019 when it released. It was disappointing for me too. I have been a die hard fan for this game no matter the opinion of others because I knew how good it could be. My faith has been rewarded with what currently is Cyberpunk 2077 2.0.\n\nI would recommend this game wholeheartedly. It has influenced me in more ways than just the digital world. I have put in 4 different playthroughs to this game. It has a uniqueness I can't seem to replicate with other game experiences. Storytelling and world building is where I get reeled in. Cyberpunk offers that cranked to 11.",

Looks and sounds fantastic, performance is great and the new skills/combat etc were super fun to play around with. Loved the main story and it's packed full of great side quests and characters.

What 2.0 brings is mainly a better perk system, shifting armor to cyberware, reduced item clutter, and police behavior more like GTA.  \n\nThe major flaw that still remains (and presumably will in perpetuity) is that its not difficult for focused character builds to become overpowered. I decided to retry a netrunner build that frankly almost never exposes my character to danger, and it still works in 2.0, at least through The Heist mission. I expect the same to be true for melee, stealth, and gun running builds.",

Missing assets files during cutscenes, characters not properly loading with the assets makes them look pantomime. The driving sections where you are a passenger are still rough and there are talking sections where the NPCs don't move their lips. The general gameplay bugs have improved.. but it's been 3 years and the cutscenes are still broken? WTF.. I wish I didn't have to complain and warn new players, but 2.0 is still riddled with the problems from 1.0.

Easily one of my top 5 favorites! I can't wait to see what CDPR has in store for the Cyberpunk universe next! I strongly hope they will carry on with first person view.\n\nBig kudos to CDPR's designers, artists and devs! This studio screams talent and style!\n\n/!\\ Cyberpunk 2077 is stunning on Steam Deck, using the detailed settings from /u/TiSoBr and punkgeek seen on ProtonDB I'm getting a solid 45-50FPS. \"GOLD\" on ProtonDB.\nhttps://www.protondb.com/app/1091500",

                "review": "This is definitely one of the best open world story games I have played in a long time. This is easily one of my top 3 games of all time. Amazing story, so much content, Easter eggs, ambiance, great music. The controls are smooth and feels great playing with a controller. I could play this game over and over again, and it would never feel the same. The characters you fall in love with. Intense drama, insane action, hearth throbbing romance, breathtaking horror. This game has it all, truly a jack-of-all. The customization is great. When they added phantom liberty, it actually intertwines with the overall story. I hope they keep that up with more DLCs. Granted it does require a lot of computer power for high graphics, and there are bugs and crashes here and there, but a game this size and depth its easy for you to ignore. The animated series to go behind this game, and to see the impact within the game that series had, makes it all the more of an amazing universe. 10/10 100% Hall of Fame level game",

                "review": "I bought this when it came out and thought it was great. I didn't have any of the performance or bug issues that were apparently present at the time, especially for console peasants. 2 years later I get Phantom Liberty on release day. Verdict? This is not only THE best expansion I've ever played, but the continuation of the story, addition of new weapons, all new melee weapon class, the addition of more dialogue with Johnny Silverhand -- most of all on seemingly unimportant side quests -- new cars, crazy new class skill combos, the new zone of Dogtown... it's all incredible. \n\nThe base game has I believe 6 endings while the new expansion has 4. If you want to play through all of them, no need to save scum. Once you beat the game and credits roll, you'll be able to continue the game afterwards, cause mayhem, do side quests, whatever -- but your quest log journal will always allow you to replay the two final missions (the base game and Phantom Liberty) over again if you want to experience the other or same endings again.\n\nBeen gaming for almost 30 years at this point and this is probably the best action RPG of the last decade, ironically only competing with The Witcher 3, another CDPR title. This game is basically if Bladerunner and Grand Theft Auto had a baby in the year 2077. I can't recommend it highly enough and its new expansion, Phantom Liberty.",

I loved the story, the game play is fun, the voice acting is very good. These are the aspects that make this game an amazing game I'll play time and time again.\n\nThe bugs, however much better they may be, are still ever present. There was a period I thought I was soft locked because the game would kill me whenever I tried to go into a mission centric vehicle. I got past this luckily but that along with many random crashes that I couldn't see a pattern to, It definitely got to me.\n\nAll this to say I enjoy this game thoroughly, I was able to get about 60 hours my first play through, including the new DLC (which was also very good). I would recommend this game but even after 2.0 still view it as early access but, man this game scratches an itch that no other has for me.",

The attention to detail in the graphics and world are amazing. They have painted a very real picture of what life may look like 50 years from now. Been playing the Story and so far its really good. Wish we could steal cars like in GTA and put them in our garage, but as the story progresses you gain access to more.\n\nMy only criticism would be the key bindings that they don't let you remap if your an arrow key / number pad player like myself. But i was able to follow the directions in the forum here and remap the \"USE\" key from F to ENTER... although like many have said, shouldn't have to do that in 2023 hahaha. But once that was worked out the game has been a blast. Highly recommended",

I just finished my second one which I can still say CDPR's craftsmanship at an immersive atmosphere in worldscapes and story telling makes Night City one of my favorite worlds and campaigns of all time..\nComparing 2.0 from 1.0, even a sliver of 1.63, the newest update is literally a whole new game, mechanic wise. Combat is heavily improved upon to where at times I contemplated this felt like a sequel with Phantom Liberty dropping. Speaking of that DLC, an amazing Spy-Thriller expansion opening up even a smaller, bigger world inside of Night City feels like a whole new city!\n     This update is something that really shouldn't be written about, but experienced, for how surreal everything feels let alone how amazingly well done it is. The only thing that makes me upset is after all this time, and brand new dlc, the game's life is over, buuuut because of that it's already creating hype for the ORION Sequel... \n\nP.S. If you read this far, you should've stopped reading earlier. So go ahead and play. Just don't forget, the game is fixed",

Also a big shout out for the various endings that actually had different quests for each one, so you don’t sit and feel like you are doing the same thing over and over again - I haven’t experienced this in other games with different endings. \n\nAlso ended up buying the DLC, which was worth it, except for maybe one mission (nightmarefuel) - had a fun ride hunting down all the achievements in this game - big thumbs up!\n",

Respect those that create the game, disrespect those that have no understanding of whats going on and only see dollar signs. \n\nThis is a good game now, great game, maybe even one for the ages... but due to it's past, it will never be renowned as it could have been. It will always have a shit stain on it's cover, and that can never be taken back, but at least the game is fixed now(mostly).",

I haven't finished it yet (90 hours play time) but so far it's the second best game I played this year. No, nothing can beat Baldur's Gate 3, not even Night City 😉\nThe graphics/visuals are arguably the best ever presented in a video game, it's just mind blowing. A captivating story supported by strong characters and the side quests are meaningful and fun to complete, never a dull moment. There's so much to explore and discover and the best way to do so is by walking through Night City. Every neighborhood is different with its own vibe and challenges. The game-play is excellent and the character building is inventive and meaningful.\n\nI will adjust my final review after beating the game including Phantom Liberty. But for now I can only recommend Cyberpunk 2077.",

The story, performances, themes, and soundtracks to this game were always absolutely incredible, but it was so hampered by bad gameplay and technical problems that it was easily one of the biggest letdowns of the decade at launch.\n\nThe team has completely resolved that. This game is absolutely stellar, from start to finish. Combat feels incredible now, with a ton of different builds all feeling unique and powerful. The graphics of this game are jaw dropping. There have been a handful of minor bugs though my last 65 hour playthourgh, but certainly nothing game breaking, minor A/V glitches at most.\n\nThe 2.0 update fixed all the major issues this game had, so people can finally experience how incredible this game is without being dragged down by all of the launch issues. Phantom Liberty is easily a GOTY contender in itself; a completely riveting narrative with hugely impactful choices and about 15 hours of content. I just have to highlight how amazing Keanu and Idris are in this game. The dynamic between the player and Johnny Silverhand is a deep, meaningful narrative which really needs to be experienced. Buy this game.",

I would recommend to watch a walk-through prior.\nOverall, this was a game I was not going to come back to because of all the bugs and issues I had on first release. \nThey did well with the new patch and have already started another play through.",

I highly suggest going into this game as spoiler free as possible, as any decision you make will impact your playthrough. The world of Cyberpunk 2077 is so immersive to the point that I felt as though it could be real. The world building and storytelling are so well done that I find it difficult to consider any other media that is even as close to perfection like Cyberpunk. The voice acting is phenomenal, with such a wide variety in casting, you can see suggest how unique and diverse Night City is, not too unlike many irl cities in the US. The only negatives I can find in this game is performance and glitches. Majority are not game breaking, but they can take you out at times. I suggest playing this game with mods installed to help mitigate them, and consider other mods to improve game-play mechanics (you can still get achievements even with mods installed!). Overall I would rate this game as it is now a 9/10. There is nothing like the world of Cyberpunk 2077, and I doubt I will ever forget the many lessons I learned in Night City!",

                "review": "I love this game so much. Even when it first released I loved this game despite all the bugs. with the 2.0 update the game has just gotten so much better.\n\nTL;DR: Good game, 2.0 update made the game even better.\n\nFor my most recent play through, I went full gorilla fists. The only range weapon I had in my kit were my grenades. It was probably the most fun I've ever had with this game. The 2.0 update making healing items and grenades a rechargeable resource instead of a limited one that you have to pick up around the world felt great.\n\nThe story is also great, though the main story being kinda short. the amount of side content is insane. There is always something to do. But because there is so much much content, you level up a lot. which isn't bad. It does mean you can quickly out level the main quest. by the time I had done the DLC and some side missions. I was level 40, build complete and no where to put my extra skill points, I had not even started the main story line. I would have liked maybe a bigger skill tree and a bigger level cap. with that being said, I do love the changes made to the skill tree in the 2.0 update, there were skills that changed the way I play the game. unlike previously where it was just some stat increases.\n\nThe new Phantom Liberty DLC is also great. The new area Dog Town was fun to explore though I had performance issues whenever I was there, going below 30 FPS every time I stepped into a car or turned around too quickly (though this could be mostly a me problem since I was streaming.) I liked the story and the new characters. just all around a really cool DLC that improves upon the base game.\n\nThe new changes to cyberware were also great. Cyberware now being the main source of the armour stat means you can wear whatever clothes you want. nothing is locked behind street cred anymore so you can buy whatever you want whenever. The new capacity meter also makes the cyberware make sense in terms of why V isn't a cyberpsycho yet.\n\nAlso the soundtrack is just really really good.",

                "review": "The first thing that strikes me about Cyberpunk 2077 is the breathtaking visuals. Version 2.0 makes Night City looked more alive, vibrant, and detailed. The game boasts impressive ray tracing technology that immerses you in a world that's both futuristic and dystopian, with neon-soaked streets and awe-inspiring cityscapes. Cyberpunk 2077 2.0 is full with content. The sprawling open world is filled with diverse activities. It is easy to get lost in Night City for hours, exploring the surroundings and uncovering hidden gems. Phantom of Liberty DLC is a must buy!\n\nThe gameplay mechanics have been significantly improved with version 2.0. Combat feels more fluid, hacking is more intuitive, and the driving experience is top-notch. The addition of new skills and abilities allows for greater customization, enabling you to tailor V to your preferred playstyle. Smart weapons build is so damn OP! I wish we could buy resources to re-spec V, limited to only 1 reset IS NOT ENOUGH to explore the different builds in this beautiful game. \n\nCyberpunk 2077 2.0 is a masterpiece of a game that has truly redeemed itself from its troubled launch back in December 2020. \n\nI have to rate 9/10!",

And the hacking technology is nice touch and keeps the game pretty interesting depends on your build.\n\nThe world and the amount of details is INCREDIBLE. Can't find good enough words to describe how amazing they are. Same with the graphics.\n\nThe control over players decisions play a great roll in all of this. One of the best free-will gameplay scenarios I’ve ever seen. You can grow relationships with these characters with an ever backstory to each one. You feel every emotion you should to the characters. and It feels like a nonstop movie \n\ni was late to this party, I heard all of the poor reviews upon its release. I gave it some time knew CD PR would fix the game. And sure enough, they've done that, I'm glad I have finally played it. I don't regret being 3 years late.\n\nFinally.\nGames like these only come around every so often.\nThank you Projekt Red for this banger! <3",

It crashed 13 times and ran at 30 FPS, the bugs were atrocious, graphic glitches, multiple bugs, the list goes on. But some how i finished the game. Even with all those problems one of the best single player, open world , story games i have ever played. I got a PC I had to play Cyberpunk again, about a year ago it was on sale $40. At that time, most of or all problems was fixed, played another 100 hours. Of course Project Red is talking DLC releasing this year, Phantom Liberty. They said it was going to be free, but of course there greed got to there head and asked for $30. Before that update released, they released the 2.0 update. A bunch of crazy improvements and changes for the game. I would say the game is worth it 9/10,",

Nothing speaks more to the flaw of capitalism than a passion project critique the same flaw getting hijacked by corporate executives who prioritize a balance sheet over the artistry behind it. \n\nWith that being said, the gameplay is pretty fun, buy on sales. \n",

                "review": "1st thing. THIS GAME IS FOR MATURE AUDIENCES. If you let your 12 year old play this you are a bad parent. Cussing constantly and straight up nudity and sex scenes (there are definitely worse things out there but that is besides the point). Read the rating and respect it. Having said that, they did include a nudity censor (before you get in the game go to the settings to enable it. You cannot do it while you are playing from the pause menu) so kudos for that too.\nNow on to the review.\n\nIf you have EVER had dreams about being a cyborg or even feeling like a super/action hero, then this game is for you! With a multifaceted, very human, compelling story complete with realistic character reactions and different endings, you will get in and not want to get out. As for gameplay, with an intricate perk system, different ways to play and an INCREDIBLY immersive environment, this game will keep you coming back for more. The cars and motorcycles feel and sound cool. The city feels like time square meets industrial city planning and ranges from beach-side city with low-rising malls to skyscrapers and alleyways and even the people you see in these different areas are different. The game rewards nearly every way of playing (except sneaking past everybody and never killing/KOing. no xp or skill reward for not being seen... except the occasional singular loot reward... still not really worth it xp-wise)\n\nYou want to go in guns blazing? There is an arm mod for exactly that.\nYou want to kill from cover while your bullets find there mark anyway? They got smarts and tech for that.\nYou want to dash around whipping out throwing weapons and hacking em up with katanas? Totally doable.\nDo you want to hack into your enemies nervous systems and have them kill each other? There is a Deck and upgrades that will help you there too.\nWith fun different body mods and weapon types that feel and play completely different, there is something for every FPS RPG fan out there. This future dystopia has everything for everyone and the heart to match it.\nAnd don't even get me started on the graphics. This. Game. Is. Beautiful. If you have the hardware to do it the ray tracing in the game is incredible. And even if you dont, it still looks amazing. Especially when it rains.\nI give this game a solid 9/10.",

                "review": "Never played CP2077 on release, started with 2.0.\n\nGame is extremely fun. While its not the RPG that CDPR promised, as an action open world game its excellent. I am most impressed by the combat and how many approaches the game allows you to utilize (stealth, melee, rambo-style, netrunner) while in battle. It really makes each encounter very interesting and fun. I was also surprised by the amount of verticality the game allows you to use (once you unlock dashing and double jumping).\n\nPresentation/sound is great but that was never an issue with CP2077.\n\nMain story is interesting so far. Side quests are pretty ok, nothing crazy but there is enough variety to keep you going.\n\nPerk system is great. This was my main gripe with the original launch of the game. While the RPG systems are light, there is enough customization here to give everyone a satisfying way of building your character.\n\nCouple of things I don't like so far:\n- even after 3 years of patches there is still buginess and jankiness here and there. Nothing gamebreaking but its still not a fully polished product - maybe a byproduct of all the 2.0 changes\n- loot could be better - finding rare weapon is great but most of the time you are just picking up cash and crafting components off enemies\n- speaking of loot the whole vanity outfit aspect is pointless. You never really see your character in 3rd person so spending time dressing it up is basically useless. My main issue with this is there is a ton of costume items in the world that have no stats at all and they just dilute the loot pool\n- driving feels off - can't put my finger exactly why but it just doesn't feel satisfying\n\nOverall still an excellent FPS open world game. Say what you will about CDPR but they did finally fix up the game to how it was (mostly) promised. Also ten times better than Starfield lol",

After 820+ hours, many play-throughs and both using and making mods for this game I feel I can now express how I feel about it clearly and with some weight to my opinion.\n\nCyberpunk 2.x with Phantom Liberty is quite simply the best overall gaming experience I have ever had in my life. To put that in context, the first computer I had accessible to me for gaming on was an Apple ][e with a monochrome green monitor and my favourite game of the time was Loderunner.\n\nIs Cyberpunk 2077 flawless? Hell no. However, it is a masterpiece of its time and deserves to be recognised as such.\n\nCDPR have demonstrated that they are master storytellers capable of developing rich, believable characters that leave a lasting impression on you. They have taken the world imagined by Pondsmith and brought it to life with incredible fidelity.\n\nThe cast of voice actors is fantastic. Idris and Keanu both do fantastic jobs bringing their respective characters to life but the voice cast across the board is superb and matches the big names with ease (perhaps the only exception being MASC V who comes across very generic to me).\n\nPre 2.0 I would have said that Very Hard mode plus a plethora of mods to increase realism and difficulty were required to make the game good. Post 2.0 and having completed a ~180 hour play-through on Very Hard without mods I can say that the game now feels solid on it's own and no longer [i]requires[/i] mods to be worth playing. In fact I would now comfortably say it feels great. Personally I will still mod in a few realism options, but really that's now just a preference thing.\n\nDespite the initial misstep around its release CDPR have remained committed to the game and eventually delivered well and truly with Phantom Liberty. It requires a decent computer to enjoy to its fullest but the headline tech like Ray Tracing is not required for that at all; it looks gorgeous regardless. I play on a Ryzen 5900X/RTX 3080 12GB/64GB RAM/Linux at 4K with no raytracing and DLSS on Balanced using a collection of optimal settings painstakingly curated by Hardware Unboxed as a baseline and this gives me a smooth as silk experience.\n\nMy top three play tips:\n[olist]\n[*]Treat Night City as a real place you live in and immerse yourself in it\n[*]Limit map filter usage to Dynamic and Service Points to avoid approaching the game as a checklist of things to do or areas to clear\n[*]Don't fast travel, instead learn to drive effectively\n[/olist]\n\nCyberpunk 2077 is an expertly delivered story experience without agendas or pandering that rivals a well made movie whilst being far more engaging. Anyone with even a passing interest in near future dystopian fiction owes it to themselves to experience this game.",

                "review": "Tried playing a few years earlier, but performance, crashes, and bugs made it hard to try amongst everything else at the time. 2.0 dropped, and I started my playthrough from the beginning, and just reached an ending in the base game. I really enjoyed my time with the game. I made a ninja build with a katana and throwing knives. The knives feel sooo good to land, but the katana makes things kind of easy/noisy, where it's just a lot of throwing yourself into combat, and it is chaos with very little strategy. The cyberware system and skill-tree allow for a pretty fun sandbox of options of playstyles to choose from, which is very cool to see.\n\nThe characters are decent, but there's really only two who've left a mark on me. It seemed like there's more of a focus on little moments before/after quests, where you get to chat with someone over a beer; those were really special. \n\nImportant choices in the game felt few and far between, but they are there. I do appreciate the amount of times the game will just let me disagree/side with a person, or just kill someone during a quest - given the proper context in the moment - and have that choice matter.\n\nThe first-person cutscenes, in my opinion, are second to none. For the first few hours, I was impressed by them, but after awhile, I stopped thinking about it and just felt immersed. Games have since come out, and they've yet to reach this same bar. But, I mean, so did Cyberpunk 2077 when it came out lol, with all the t-posing going on. \n\nI got the game 50% off, and had no regrets. With the 2.0 stuff, I'd likely be okay with full price as well, but now I'm interested in buying the DLC and making some changes to my build to focus more on gunplay and hacking.",

The 2.0 update and Phantom Liberty DLC have done a lot to round out the experience. They've reworked the loot and skills for the better. I keep wanting to go back and try all these different builds for V, which I don't normally do in a game like this. The variety of endings you can get have also compelled me to go back and try different paths.\n\nIt may have taken a while for it all to come to fruition, but they (eventually) hit it out of the park with this one.",

                "review": "This is a game like no other. The world it created managed to be vibrant, unique and different. \nI beat the base game at version 1.61 and did the DLC at version 2.01. Unfortunately those numbers do matter. I did not experience the bug filled mess that was launch. Its a much better experience now and only improving. The update did not melt my graphics card, but dialled back a lot of the RPG elements for more of an exciting experience where spending perk points and breaking levels felt meaningful and fun. \nUltimately if you're used to shoot 'em up games, shooting will feel clunky. Compared to say a fallout game, the gun types, knives, mantis blades and nanowire were all interesting variations on combat. Ultimately I counted on smart guns, riccochets and being able to shoot through things to compensate for a less than ideal gun combat experience. \nDriving was worse than any GTA game, and honestly the part I liked least. Which is a shame because they spent so much time on cars, and hyped the heck out of car combat prior to the expansion launch.\nDespite this they managed to build a dynamic virtual city and tell a badass cyberpunk story filled with compelling characters. There are a lot of false choices true, but there are many real ones and hidden ones that show up other places in interesting ways. Phantom liberty had 4 endings. The main game had 5 (now 6 wildly different endings) and yet if you rushed the main storyline and didn't do the rewarding side quests you can only choose the two worst of them.\nUltimately it was a fun gaming experience where there were choices in combat, choices in dialogue and solid characters behind them all. Until phantom liberty there were no cookie cutter side quests or fetch quests. Everything had a twist and an interesting reason for doing it that felt world consistent. And phantom liberty only added 2 radient quests, and much more of that.\nIt was a great gaming experience of the kind that only comes along every few years. A flawed masterpiece!",

It has absolutely everything to keep you sucked in. Graphic, Gameplay, Story, Audio... It's just perfection (personaly best game i've ever played so far).\n\nGameplay wise everyone's gonna find a way to play this game for themselves. You can make so many different builds and approach the fight differently.\n\nStory wise the game is so deep and your choices matters a lot and i personaly get attached to characters a lot of this game so some of the choices are very emotional.\n\nAll game i feel like i'm watching/playing in a movie. All of the cutscenes are so real and you can lose yourself.\n\nI'm really sad that CDPR released this game the way they did and lots of peeps lost trust/not gonna play this game now... If the game was released the way it's now... It would have a chance to be GOTY (hard choice This or Baldur's Gate 3).\n\nI recommend everyone this game and i hope that peeps who ditched it before, will give it a second chance.",

I will start off by saying that this game is the #1 game I have ever played, and I have played a lot of games. I understand that the game had a rough start, but at least instead of being unfinished like a lot of games are now a days upon release, this game was complete, but  just was not very run-able at the start (lol). Now that those problems were fixed, this game was able to truly shine. In addition, the developers released update 2.0 and Phantom Liberty, making the game even better. \n\nIt would take me a while to list everything amazing about the game, but here are a few that stood out to me:\n- This game is extremely immersive and feels like you are the main character of a movie. Character interactions are extremely detailed and tailored. From the body language to the dialogue, every interaction feels like it is real and important. I really love the dialogue in this game especially. In addition, actions scenes and cut scenes really add to the story and helps the player to feel the emotions of their character\n- World design is another way in which this game shines. I know that it is based off of a trpg and the developers did a fantastic job of bring that world to life. There is deep lore, history, and world development. The world also feels greater than yourself and has great world building.\n- This ties into my first point but the story and side missions are all detailed and extremely impactful. They help develop a sense of the world and there are many different ways to tackle missions as well \n- like I said I could list points all day (combat, customization, variability in builds and game play mechanics, etc)\n\nOverall, at least where the game is now, has set an industry standard and demonstrated what a top tier game is. I look forward to continuing to play, but also seeing more content over the years. Thanks to the developers for making this game!",

Get a mod manager to make it easier, and spend 1 hour picking mods off the internet and 6 straight hours messing around. Get new vehicles, clothes, weapons, hardware, car modification shops, apartments, public transport systems, unlock the map's invisible walls and keep mission interior spaces open to be always accessible. The only loading screens you'll see in this game are save loading and fast traveling, virtually no door or elevator has a full on black screen, all elevators on the outside are see through with no loading screens, close to all doors leading to interiors have no loading screens. Game has improved a lot since last year, and i pretty much a complete game.\nSmall note: I haven't played the expansion yet.",

We were asking them to create the story immersion of The Witcher 3 with the variety of activities in Grand Theft Auto V and the open world exploration of The Elder Scrolls.\n\nYet despite it's flaws in direct comparison to each of those other games, alone what Cyberpunk 2077 achieves as an interactive experience is absolutely incredible.\n\nI was only able to truly appreciate this after my expectations for Starfield were shattered, as they essentially delivered an 8 year old game with a new coat of paint, and yet worse in so many more ways.\n\nI am so sorry CD Project Red for anything I may have done to fan those initial flames online with our disappointments, I had developed my own impossible vision for your game, and I couldn't appreciate it until now.\n\nCyberpunk 2077 is now a game that shares a status amongst my all time favorites, in that I've now purchased it across multiple platforms, multiple times, just to help ensure that the wheels of capitalism give you another chance to make an amazing game for us to experience.\n\nThank you CD Project Red. From the bottom of my heart, I'm sorry, and thank you.",

                "review": "First of all of course the game is gorgeous because that's what they spent the most dev time on. Dogtown and the expansion content even better. Despite all the flaws, which I'll get into, I'll never forget the look and feel of Night City. Played all the story and side quests and gigs. 80-100 hours it's hard to say because I go afk a lot. \n\nIn 2023 Cyberpunk is still very flawed. I encountered some game-breaking bugs that seem to have been patched with 2.01.  The entire first week of Phantom Liberty being live, the game would only display Xbox controller prompts for everything and I had to stop playing. I consider that game-breaking. I also had my computer completely hang a few times and decided to wait for a patch, which did come a few days later. For what it's worth I played the whole thing on 1440p Ultra, but without ray tracing.\n\nEven after 2.01 there are many many immersion breaking bugs that required a quit and reload. UI would break constantly, cars would be set to have terrible handling. The driving in general is awful and you can only slightly redeem this system once you get access to a car with better handling (I recommend the Samum because it also has missiles+guns, or the Caliburn which seems to have the best handling overall). \n\nThe narrative pacing of this game is really bad. There is way too much unskippable dialogue and your voiced POV character V is  unlikeable. Every npc is unlikeable as a matter of fact. The ones I like the most are the ones that talk the least. I love Keanu irl but he is not a good actor. Sorry Keanu. Idris Elba was a better actor but he is only in the expansion.\n\nGame holds your hand way too much and is very low stakes. I had to turn difficulty to Hard and then Very Hard, which means the enemies can kill me but more likely it's hard because they soak up a ton of bullets. There is no reason to try and be stealthy, the game doesn't punish you for dying or getting the cops called on you in any significant way. You don't lose XP, and it's not even like in GTA where you are forcibly taken to jail or the hospital when you mess up. In Cyberpunk you just get reloaded to the checkpoint, never more than a minute or 2 behind where you were. \n\nIf they wanted to make a movie they should have made a movie. Game constantly stops you from playing and makes you listen to npc dialogue or demands you go do something you don't want to do. Video game stories should be up to the player to create and discover as much as possible, especially when there is an open world. Show, don't tell. I almost got a refund because the first 2 hours are just cutscene after cutscene. Honestly this doesn't abate much once you get into the game properly. The open world in Cyberpunk is more like a break from the unskippable npc dialogue and that is backwards to what a good game should be imo. Let a player play.\n\nThat being said I actually managed to play this game all the way through. I would say it was decent, I'll go ahead and recommend it if you can run it. I did my best to break it and play it the way I wanted. I had fun once I got the perks I wanted and upgraded my gear. The perks and gear really don't matter though, and I don't understand why a first person game has so many cosmetic clothing items, it's not like you can see them. Don't bother too much with exploration on your own, the quests will take you all over the place if you just go from one to the next. There isn't enough emergent experience here to call this open world truly great but if you just want to stand around and take screenshots and soak it in, Night City is a vibe. I would say buy Cyberpunk on sale, don't feel fomo at all especially if your pc can't handle it yet. It isn't worth the hype.",

The open world was hit or miss, but I am pretty sick of open worlds in general.  \n\nAfter the Update and expansion the combat went from decent to super fun. Obliterating people with the charged tech shotguns never gets old.  I somehow managed to beat the entire game without using a single hack. I am not even certain what I am missing to perform them. I must be using an incompatible implant or something, but either way that's not really my style.  Either charging in head first or using a silenced pistol.  The weapons I got from the expansion were significantly better than anything I used prior.  The game does an excellent job leaving you in moments of silence with characters to just take everything in...however by the very end of my time playing the structures formulaic nature started to become a little noticeable.  I didn't play till well after launch so I dont have that to stain my memory.  Graphics are pretty good, beautiful in fact.  The one mechanic I didnt love were the braindance investigations.  They always went on a little too long IMO.\n\n9/10",

This was not the case 2 years back, when I bought it on day 1 and was frustrated with it. Anyway, my second time over, I'm experiencing it the way I should have and enjoying my time. Will get the DLC, which should be the cherry on top for this experience and finally heal those wounds.\n",

The layouts feel unique, not just some copy and paste of the same building 100 times. Buildings are also decorated with decor that actually makes sense to the rooms for the most part. for instance a bedroom looks like a bedroom not just a bed and a random appliance or something like a Bethesda game. The way you interact with objects and the world is very fluid with the gameplay. \n\nAnd best of all, no loading screens!!! I don't know what it is about standing in an elevator doing nothing, waiting longer than a loading screen would have taken anyways, to get up a build that is so enjoyable but it is! just being able to walk in and out of every building without loading is beautiful.\n\nMy only complaint is that the combat AI is not great when playing as a sniper. Enemies never really put pressure on you unless they are melee and there are not that many of those. Ranged enemies will come close to your location sometimes, but will stay at a distance or around a corner. On the hardest setting this game was still a cake walk with a few exceptions. I will say the battles in the new DLC missions have been a big improvement on this though.\n\nDefinitely got my moneys worth out of this one.",

Teleporting cops, no car chases when you are wanted, etc.\nI knew it does NOT try to be GTA and I thought everyone who did compare it with that was a moron.\n\nStill, I couldn't get into as all these bugs destroyed the immersion for me.\n\nThe gameplay itself was nice, but not nice enough to give me enough joy over the bugs.\nIIRC, I did not even finish the tutorial heist and let the game rot in my library.\n\n\nAfter 2.1 I picked it up again and hell, has it changed.\nWhile the term 'bug-free' is a fantasy word when it comes to open world games, it's as far fixed to enjoy it to the fullest.\nI finally jumped into the main game and had a blast.\n\nMissions are unique, side gigs are slightly repetitive (as they are in basically all open world games).\nYet the ones where a character is behind it (Panam, River, Judy, etc.) are often very funny and even the random NPCs are far better than in Starfield for example (at least they do not give creepy looks XD).\n\n\nI haven't jumped into Phantom Liberty yet, but after doing a bit more of the remaining gigs in the main game, I'll be happy to jump into.\n\n\nClear thumbs up!\nOh and the reason why there are almost no screens or videos from my playthrough available...\nGames which I rather play than showcase are especially good to me. ;)",

Other than that though CDPR has done it yet again on an amazing immersive story, attention to detail, and visual satisfaction.",

I've stuck with this game since I bought it back on the PS4 and it's amazing how far Cyberpunk 2077 has come and wish that there were more DLCs to come, but for what we have it's quite bountiful. Between the beefy expansion, the 2.0 update, the main story and side quests, the combat, new and improved implants and the beautiful night city. This game is well worth the $60 and if you see it on sale, grab it 100%. I makes me look forward to the sequel to 2077 and the future for CD Projekt Red.",

                "review": "Simply put, this is an excellent game. The detail put into Night City makes it absolutely incredible to explore, in a way that few games can compare to. Usually when I explore a video game world, I get the feeling that what I am seeing is a reduction, a minimized, simplified version of what it might actually look like in the real world. Even some of the best designed and detailed fictional worlds give me that sense (such as Red Dead Redemption 2 for example). Night City does not feel like this. It genuinely feels like a realistic, lived in city, and for that I think it is already a really unique experience. Additionally, Cyberpunk delivers very well in terms of satisfying game play and engaging story. There's so many different play styles to be had and different story paths to go down that it greatly encourages replayability. \n\nThat being said I would like to nitpick a few details. For one, despite this vast, detailed world that Cyberpunk offers, I felt like there were very little opportunities for true roleplaying decisions. For example, Cyberpunk has all these really cool gangs and factions that you meet, but you can't really decide how you want to go about interacting with them. While the story does let you make some decisions as to who you side with in certain instances, there is no way to fully commit to certain factions. V always feels like a lone wolf no matter what you do. Compare this to a game like Fallout New Vegas which lets you side with any faction you like and actually significantly alter your playthrough by doing this. In Cyberpunk however, it just feels like all these gangs might look cool, but they're ultimately the same, just NPCs for you to beat up.\n\nAdditionally, there are some design choices that I think diminish immersion that could have been easily improved. To illustrate this, let's compare eating food in Cyberpunk to Red Dead Redemption 2. In Red Dead, I can go to an Inn, order food off that Inn's actual menu, get served that actual food, and eat it. In Cyberpunk, if you speak to a food vendor, you get sent to an inventory interface where you can buy the food. Without ever seeing it, it appears in your inventory. Then, to eat it, you have to exit the interface to go back to gameplay, open your own inventory interface, find the food in your inventory, and click it. Then V \"eats\" the food which you never see. Acquiring clothes works similarly, which again, contrasts greatly with RDR2's system where you actually see yourself trying on clothes in a changing room. (Side note, it is very annoying that you can't see what clothes look like on V before you buy them.) I know these sound like incredibly picky nitpicks, but my point is just that in a game so beautifully realized and immersive, I really would have liked if they fully committed to that immersion. Let me interact with these gangs and factions that you created and made really cool and interesting. Let me actually eat the food from a food vendor. Let me see myself riding on a train or something when I fast travel. In my opinion, little details like this would have elevated an already great game to something truly revolutionary.",

I told myself to wait until it was the perfect game we were promised, and I'm glad that I did! Everything about this game just clicks right away, the skill trees, the vehicle combat, the visuals! That's not even mentioning the story which is absolutely top tier, including the side missions and most of the gigs! Anyways great job CDPR, thank you for not giving up on your game after everything!\n\nTLDR: Buy and play this game ASAP!",

All the characters, story lines, and overall feel of night city is one I can never forget. When I completed the main story and the DLC I felt something from a game that hadn't been there for a long time. If you haven't played this game or the DLC please do yourself a favor and play it.",

The missions are impactful, the game oozes style. 9/10.",

Of course there are still bugs present, but you cant have a game this massive with out a few warts popping up, don't let them bother you too much because everything about this game is worth ignoring them for. After multiple play through, getting all achievements, finishing the DLC story multiple times and just spending hours futzzing around the city I still want more. I wish there was more to this world and its stories and its characters I could my teeth into. Give me epilogues. give me back stories via comics, or books, or more animes, or movies I don't care. I want more of this world and its characters, but sadly the one and only DLC has been released and CDPR is moving on to more things. I hope more in this world as well. I highly suggest picking this game up if you are a fan of role playing games as its 100% worth every penny.",

AND TOTALLY REDEEM YOURSELF.\n\nReal Talk though I liked this game before the anime and the DLC. It really did annoy me how much people hated this game, and it annoys me even more that everyone is sucking its dick. Its always been a good game. Amazing guns, great story, great characters, and the single best cyberpunk city ever. It was never a bad game, just ungodly buggy (And coming from a Bethesda and STALKER fan, that wasn't nothing).",

Should describe it in a way you dears become more willing to buy and play it, so it's a bit hard though XD.\nThis game has one of the best story lines i've ever played. Decisions are pretty much hard to decide so yah, you should get fully involved in the game to know what to decide in each moment.\nThe graphic is so brilliant that I don't see the urgency to talk about it.\nVariety of weapons, different abilities, different vehicles to ride on, different enemy types and robots beside other great items have made this game much much much more \"I should play\".\nSex scenes and love between other characters also are a great part you know :)\nI really wanted to be at the place of those who haven't played CyberPunk, 'cause I want to experience it once more :')\nBut my friends, one important thing, if you want to buy cyberpunk, please please buy the phantom liberty DLC too, the game and the dlc with each other are a masterpiece not solo :D\nI hope we could see Johny alive in his own body, SongBird out of the blackwall working beside Reed, and V ...\n",

With that in mind i uninstalled until the Phantom liberty DLC and Patch 2.0.\n\nIt was like a different game, able to do things that were originally described  in the game and collect achievements that i had completed before but would never pop. With the new patch primed, i started fresh and 100%'d the game. \n\nAs an overall patch and DLC, CD PROJEKT RED have really out done themselves with the quality improvements to the game and would highly recommend you consider the game now Patch 2.0 is here.\n\nPlease keep in mind; There are still some small bugs like the occasional floating person, enemy stuck in the floor and random floating cars which i found rarer than before but they are still present. On ultra with a 13900K and 4090 the game performed flawless with no crashes and no FPS drops like before.\n\nWould recommend as a 10/10 after patch.",

Over my 60 hours of playtime I've maybe encountered 3-5 bugs, only one of which required me to reload a safe.\nBoth the story and the world building are very good.\nThe Gameplay feels a lot less repetitive compared to other big open world titles. My only issue with the game is that as you progress, enemies and general difficulty don't seem to scale with your character (or at least not enough to be very noticeable). Therefore after a while the combat does get boringly easy, despite playing on the \"hard\" difficulty.\nOverall still a very enjoyable gaming experience. 9/10 would recommend.",

Perk trees were very nice to progress and you can feel the power gain from an upgrade.\n\nHave not completed the DLC as of right now but plan on doing so in the next day or two but what I have done so far in it is extremely promising. \n\nIt took some time but this game is in my top 5 favourite of all time.",

That said CDPR has redeemed themselves in my opinion and I look forward to the next game in this franchise.",

                "review": "To preface my review, I didn't play Cyberpunk 2077 until Phantom Liberty and the 2.0 changes. I have no reference for how the game used to be. I also knew very little about the game and story before starting. I was only spoiled on the nature of Keanu Reeves' character, Johnny, and that the game has multiple endings. I otherwise came in pretty new and unfamiliar to the game aside from some of the 2.0 change complaints in user reviews (mostly about the new skill tree and enemy scaling). I was in the mood for a cyberpunk style adventure and this was all hitting the front page at the time so I picked it up.\n\nI really enjoyed my time with Cyberpunk 2077. Gun play is solid and I personally didn't find any particular issue with the 2.0 skill tree or the enemy scaling but that could be down to my own build and play style. While there are some restrictions to how the main character, V, is able to be personality wise as they are an established and voiced character, I never felt like one play style could be less viable than another (such as stealth vs guns blazing). And even though the Phantom Liberty content is telegraphed in the mission journal, I wasn't paying too much attention to it as I figured it was an end game expansion. I was caught off guard when I was doing a mission and all of a sudden the title drop of Phantom Liberty hit. It seems to have been integrated into the main game fairly well with extra dialog options for your in game acquaintances after things start going down in the DLC. The only real overall negative I have is that the driving is terrible on mouse and keyboard. First person view inside the cars tend to be limited with a lot of the interior in the way (motorcycles were much better), there isn't an on hood or from license plate view like many games offer, and the third person chase camera will not follow if you even slightly move the mouse at all. I get the feeling the focus was on being able to drive and shoot at the same time but that was needed so infrequently that I would have preferred the focus to be just solid driving. It's a shame because the fluidity of the city and lack of loading screens while getting around can really pull you in. But later on I leaned more toward just using the fast travel stations I found while driving around, especially when I'd have to cross to opposite corners of the map for different missions. I certainly praise the vehicle delivery system when I still had a bit of distance to cover.\n\nAnd now for the big one to talk about: bugs. I will say that in the beginning, the game was very stable and bug free. I was pretty impressed after hearing the bad word of mouth for so long. However, I did start to see some things later. Phantom Liberty's content was definitely the most problematic with animations not lining up or breaking out of sequence. I recall in particular a scene where someone tilt their car seat back to avoid being seen and they kept popping back up at the standard driving position during the cutscene. And I don't know if it was Phantom Liberty kicking it off or just the number of hours I'd played to get there but I started seeing more animation breaking and people spawning hovering in midair. It was infrequent enough to not be a problem for me but it definitely all seemed to really kick off once I hit new content. Earlier on, the few crashes I had were after quitting the game when it didn't matter. But after playing for about 50 to 60 hours, I did get a couple of crashes while playing. One kicked me to the desktop with the standard \"game has flatlined\" error but another completely locked up the game to the point where even Task Manager couldn't take priority over the game's window and I had to restart the computer. A more gameplay impacting one was a perk that turned on optic camouflage while crouch running. Without spoiling, there is an item in Phantom Liberty that takes its spot during the mission. It would break the optic camouflage perk until I refunded it (for free thankfully) and unlocked it again. Also had issues where the use of said spoiler item would prevent me from opening the inventory or map unless I saved and reloaded. Is this all 2.0 related issues or just Phantom Liberty? Hard to say since they were released hand in hand. No softlocks and nothing frequent enough to stop me playing but just know there are likely bugs to work around.\n\nI can definitely recommend this game. I had a good time being a merc in Night City and really found myself getting caught up in the characters and the story. It wasn't \"me\" in Night City but V was a decent foil for my adventure and they handle themselves well enough to how I wanted to play the game. Just set your expectations for a few open world bugs and you may enjoy roaming, hacking, shooting, and whatever else in Cyberpunk 2077's world. It's a pretty good experience!",

They just wanna re-experience the magic of olden days when you experienced open worlds for the very first time. They are looking at it through the lens of rose tinted glasses of past and judging the game against an impossible standard they have conjured up in their heads.\n\nOnce bitten twice shy. Don't listen to the burned. They are still miffed about the lies and deception of CDPR and they will carry their bitterness to their graves. Do not follow them. Use your own judgement. Your wallet is not beholden to the woes of others. Listen, sympathise; but make decision for the present, not the past.\n\nThis game is a marvel of technical design and technological prowess. It is pushing the gaming industry and will be remembered as one of the cornerstone in gaming history. Nothing is perfect. Nothing will ever be. But this is what striving for it looks like.",

Got through the intro (10-20 hours i think) and only came back recently to finally give it a full run. And god it is now one of my favorite games of all time\n\n(Haven't played DLC yet and played on Normal mode Corpo path.)\n\nThe characters are interesting, well written, and well modeled.\nJohnny Silverhand is a genuinely amazing character that i loved to see anytime he's on screen.\nV is malleable enough for the player to insert into but still brims with personality in every voice line. \nThe combat is fun although admittedly nothing to write home about. \nNetrunning can make you feel overpowered as shit in the late game if you build it right, or at all.\nThe changes made in 2.0 genuinely improved my experience so much \n(Although it seemed to make glitches a lot more prevalent in my play through, I had barely any before 2.0)\nThe main story is amazing and overall i had a great experience with the game.\n\nI only really have 2 complaints with the game. The Glitches and The Secret Ending.\nAs far as the glitches go they're still really annoying from time to time and can really break your immersion fast. \n\nWhile finishing the secret ending i came across a glitch where every time i hopped in the AV to finish the epilogue i would instantly die, luckily someone else had the same issue and all i needed to do was spam open the map while getting in, but still. Not to mention that when fighting adam smasher he got stuck on geometry about 30 sec into the fight and could barely hurt me.\n\nBut to more specifically complain about Don't Fear The Reaper. Although the ending is cool, its also just not worth the effort to get it, not at all.\nI finished the game originally at around level 30 and planned to get the endings then go back and complete all the side missions, and while every ending was pretty reasonable in difficulty, everything just stopped when i got to Don't Fear The Reaper. I wanted to play it last sort of as a last ho rah before just playing through all the side content. Only to find out not only does it require you to be max level to realistically attempt it also makes you sit through the credits and reload either back into game or the main menu before loading up again. It's understandable for it to be difficult being the One Man Army ending, but its not like it's difficult because of enemy placement or selection, everything is simply higher level than you. boring and bullshit, really cool that the floor one guards are tougher than the Arasaka special forces i mowed down a hundred of 30 min ago.\n\nNow after getting over the fact i'd have to grind to max level it genuinely was a good time, the side missions especially became a sort of relaxing chore in a good way. But then after playing through Don't Fear The Reaper, which was admittedly awesome. It has the same fucking ending as the rouge ending. Absolute dogshit, grind out 20 levels because of an arbitrary level requirement then get an ending you've already seen before with an added 6 lines of dialouge from rouge. Disappointing at best.\n\n\nThat all being said. The game overall is still amazing and one of my favorite pieces of media I've ever consumes.\n\n9/10\nNomad Ending is the best. Can't wait to play Phantom Liberty.",

                "review": "2.0 brings quite a lot of changes. Game is more challenging now as you can't just one shot everything that moves through walls with the silenced non-lethal tech rifle anymore. There are even actual boss battles now. The game still gets easy about halfway through, but it's much more engaging experience overall.\n\nSome of the changes make the game more immersive as well. With police system it feels like the city actually reacts to what you're doing (even though it's usually enough to break line of sight and just sit there until wanted level goes away) and updated driving, while still not of the level of something like GTA is definitely a welcome change.\n\nSome changes are underwhelming though. Economy is still broken, upgrade system is largely meaningless. especially at higher tiers and new skill tree is... more linear. I've found myself getting most of what i wanted to get in the first half of the game and beyond that there was little to improve my current playstyle. That encouraged me to test other stuff for a bit, but by the end of the game I had 9 unspent perk points and nothing to spend it on (nothing that I would use that is). Between that and the new armor system that makes clothing mostly cosmetic I ended up without much build progression in the second half of the game.\n\nSurprisingly, 2.0 was a buggier experience than the launch version for me. Unhinged traffic/driving AI, visual bugs (mostly related to Path Tracing so can't really fault CDPR for that), couple of crashes, UI features getting blocked where they shouldn't (most common is dialogue skip feature being unavailable until reload, that happened often, most likely it's getting blocked for phone calls or other sequences where you can't skip lines, but then not getting unblocked afterwards, same happened with other \"special\" UI states like not being able to open inventory, but those happen less often in the game so the bug is less frequent as well). Even had a random out of nowhere deaths at one point in one of the ending scripted story sequences (that can be fixed equally as randomly by opening and closing the map before that interaction and/or going into it naked), also weird dialogue preceding this sequence as if character reaction to your choices were switched up between 2 options.\n\nPhantom Liberty is great. The story is good (some of the choices are better written than the others so you might want to try all routes, I ended up going with the opposite ending from what I initially chose), the acting is top notch and the new district is very distinct. \n\nAll that said, I loved the game. It's still imperfect, but it's a great world with great atmosphere and an interesting cast of characters so if you didn't play it yet for some reason, now is a good time to try.",

But now, with the new update, it runs so smooth and this game is so much fun! \n\nIt's kind of like GTA mixed with hacking elements like in Watch Dog. This game has so many hours of gameplay with 3 different types of characters that live different lifestyles and in different locations. The replayability for Cyberpunk is superb, something that is not found in many games. \n\nPlaying this game with a controller is way better.)",

There are still some minor hiccups here and there but nothing gamebreaking, more of annoying visual stuff that happen - had seen an enemy bug in a texture twice around my 80 hr gameplay. Once had to reload the save because I got stuck in a corner and NPC was blocking me. But that is about it.\n\nThe new revamped skill trees are goood, by the end of the game you can make your V in untouchable machine and have multiple of the best perks in different categories, so the combat is flexible and you can choose how to approach and resolve gigs if you get bored playing a certain way. \n\nNPC's are better overall, not standing in front of the car, police is better. Still there are ways to cheese some situations, like getting a high ground and murdering everyone without anyone touching you or standing outside of enemy area of trigger and just use sniper bouncing in and out. But other than that the combat is really dynamic. \n\nHuge variety of weapons, cyberware overhaul even further enhances the possibility to make your playstyle more dynamic and fluid. So far really fun combat experience.\n\nAs a witcher 3 fan I didn't feel THAT magic that witcher had in regards of story and characters, but it was good. The world and the concepts upon which it is built is good, mature and \"believable\". Banter between Johnny and V, their relationship was very well done. Keanu has some amazing moments, facial expressions and one-liners, especially in the DLC.\n\nThere is more good than bad with cyberpunk. If you want a good story - it got it. If you don't care about story that much anyway, it offers great FPS experience. Some of the guns you can get are fun as hell, you just can't stop shooting them lol.",

Both the main game and DLC are excellent and must-plays, considering only this, the game is a 10/10... That said it is also a major bugfest. I played during patch 2.01 and 2.02 (can't even think what it was during release) and I still endured bugs every single day. Some tolerable, the game taking time loading some doors, others annoying like the car felling through the ground, and some game-breaking bugs where the game would crash completely (got saved sometimes because I would do manual saves backups frequently).... This got to be one of my most divise games i ever played... I loved it and i hated it xD still in the end i guess i just want more ^^ 9/10",

The parade quest was one of the most immersive and cool game experiences. Voice acting is great, characters are intriguing and you get to run around with Keanu Reeves the whole time.\n\nOnly thing I'd knock it for is performance. Its good enough to be playable and not detract from the gameplay but it definitely could and should be better.",

The story is decent yet short in length, but where Cyberpunk 2077 truly shines is in its world. Night City does not need gimmicks to immerse you into its world. No random encounters, no birds to guide you to treasure. Just a broken, dirty, stunning dystopia for you to explore.",

It is 100% worth every penny.\nI played the game at 1440p Medium settings at 40-60 fps. I also completed all content and achievements. \n\nThe Good\n- Story/world is immersive\n- Amazing combat \n- Skill tree to make combat your own (stealth, gun nut, net runner are just some options)\n- Best graphics in any game so far\n- Updated Police and driving\n- dialogue makes characters feel like actual characters and not just an NPC there to further a plot point\n- You get to make your own choices in certain situations like dealing with gangs, endings, your hit list\n- Hours of content\n- Hardcore modding community to make the game even better\n\nThe bad \n- Still not the game that was promised\n- End game is a little disappointing (your ending doesn't change anything about the game. It just puts you back before you did the ending you wanted)\n- DLC story is a little underwhelming (feels like a different iteration of V and Jackie)\n- level scaling\n- Lower end hardware will struggle a bit and may have to use FSR and low settings to be at 60 \n- Some game breaking glitches (the one i found was patched in the 2.02 update)",

                "review": "Cyberpunk 2077 mirrors the movie Morbius in pretty much no way except one: lightning struck them twice. With Morbius, it was releasing in theaters only to completely bomb. With CP2077, it was getting hyped up only to not deliver. Only the second time, they released a kind of decent show with good animation and the game wasn't a complete shitshow performance wise, so no-one noticed.\n\nSeriously though I tried playing this game at launch, quit around twenty hours in, heard it got updates so I hopped back in, quit after ten hours in, heard it got more updates, quit ten hours in, until finally 2.0 and Phantom Liberty dropped and I said, \"Fuck it. This is the last time. I'm beating this game.\" And I did! And it was extremely mid!\n\nThe problems are as fuckin follows: crafting, non-Iconic weapons, weapon mods, consumables, and clothing are pretty much all boring or useless, most times both. Same with vendors. Vehicular combat might as well not exist because while they apparently updated it, it isn't actually implemented into the main game, so there's no point to it. Melee combat feels really bad because either you're getting fucked by bad hitboxes and jank mechanics or you're repeatedly slapping someone with what feels like a particularly wet sock. Combat in general gets very boring very quickly because enemy variety would be pretty much rock bottom EVEN IF every enemy that wasn't \"dude with gun\" wasn't much rarer than \"dude with gun.\" Two of the other enemies, robots which are rare and mechs which are uber rare, are also still basically \"dude with gun.\"\n\nThe police system is still pretty bad and pointless. Cyberware is still largely underwhelming, with only one (the cyberdeck) improving in any interesting way as you get better versions. The ones that are interesting are only interesting the first time you get them, because, again, none of them improve outside of additional or improved percentage buffs. Tattoos, scars, and cyberware options in the character creator are still annoying because your choices are basically \"so minor you probably won't notice it\" or \"you have covered your entire body in nonsense.\"\n\nLife paths still have no real effect other than the start and dialogue options, most of which (at least for corpo) are astoundingly bland, boring, or straight up idiotic. Many quests still have very underwhelming or outright bad rewards. At least one has a WORSE reward than on release because of the updates that made clothing useless. Characters still have lopsided attention given to them and their quests, and most still fall off the face of the world after their quests are done outside of canned responses, the same few questions, or a short convo after certain (probably two or three at most?) game events. Endings are still very bad, poorly written, and basically yank choice out of your hand to hamfist a certain close to your story, including Phantom Liberty's.\n\nIn fact, I didn't even play much of Phantom Liberty because the gameplay had gotten so stale due to that aforementioned rock bottom enemy variety and no real meaningful avenues of progression that I was bored to tears by the time it was finally available to play. It also didn't really have an interesting premise in my opinion and felt way less prepared to handle my choices than the main game, so I didn't bother beyond the opening mission and a few side quests.\n\nThe relic perk tree it adds has some interesting abilities but even wide spreading builds will only need, like... three of the trees. Unless you're into going to the ripperdoc every other mission to switch out your chrome. So there's no point getting the rest, even though I think you CAN get enough points to get the rest, which makes me wonder why you can't do the same with the rest of the attributes and perk trees from the main game. Most perk trees are also still combat oriented, by the way, maybe even more so after the update. They're also now organized in levels which need a certain level of points in their respective attribute to level up, ranging from 9 to 15 to 20, with the only really interesting ones coming at 9. This meshes really well with the fact attribute checks now scale with your level, meaning that if you don't hard level an attribute you'll be told to suck the game's dick and fail 90% of the checks. Basically this means that unless you know for sure what you want to specc towards, you'll be using that single-use respecc at some point, probably early on. This also doesn't help that many, MANY perks are just straight up traps. So situational that you'll pretty much never use them, like any of the vehicle perks. Oh also some perks need at least three points before you get an interesting effect, so... have fun with that.\n\nIn short: the game is still boring in numerous areas, outright bad in others, underwhelming in even more. The good (pretty much just lots of the story, the art direction and world, and the feel of shooty gun go bang bang) doesn't outweigh the bad. This isn't a redemption story for CDPR; this is the story of a corporation leveraging a brilliant PR team, the short attention span and low standards of general audiences (which isn't even really their fault given the absolute slop most AAA game studios vomit out these days), and what is fundamentally a bare minimum amount of effort to earn back their good will that they'll assuredly abuse again in the future.\n\nTldr; in a vacuum I could maybe say this game is fine because a lot of the story, the presentation, and atmosphere carry a LOT of it. But in a vacuum I also probably wouldn't have finished it because so much of it is bad that I was bored and frustrated halfway through to the point I wanted to quit. The only reason I didn't is because I wanted to be able to say with at least some authority that this is not a No Man's Sky type situation. This is not the tale of a company botching the release of a good game only to refine it into a masterpiece. This is the tale of a company botching the release of a \"just fine\" game and leveraging their brilliant PR department and gamers' short attention spans and low standards to pretend they turned it into something brilliant.\n\nDon't buy this game. Don't play this game. It just isn't worth it. There are better games out there.",

                "review": "[h1][u]TLDR:[/u][/h1]\nCyberpunk 2077 doesn't revolutionize the open-world RPG genre, but does enough things acceptably to warrant an 'okay' recommendation.\n\nPost 2.0 update 2023, the game is a serviceable experience. CDPR fixed a majority of the bugs, glitches, and gripes I had with prior to the 2.0 gameplay rework, made the skill/perk tree much more interesting for player build development, and overall streamlined many moment-to-moment gameplay elements. The story hasn't changed much, if at all, so if you're a first time player you'll have that to dig into. \n\n[h1]GENRE:[/h1]\nFirst-person, open world RPG, FPS & melee combat\n\n[h1]GAMEPLAY:[/h1]\nYou play as a freelance mercenary that can take random jobs (quests) from fixers throughout the city to do an assortment of tasks from killing troublesome gang leaders, uploading/downloading data from a PC, stealth missions, etc. Your play style is based around the points you invest into your 5 character attributes, and within each attribute is a perk tree with selectable perks tailored toward a certain set of tactical abilities. \n\nFor example, if you want to be a melee user who swings bladed weapons and dashes around enemies mid-air, you would likely invest into the 'Reflexes' attribute and then select the relevant perks that boost those abilities. Or if you want to be a netrunner who uploads debuffs into enemies in real time and hacks devices around a battlefield, you would invest into the 'Intelligence' attribute and pick perks that help you do those actions. Perks can be refunded at any time, but attribute points can only be refunded once (without mods). \n\nYou can install cyberware into your body to further enhance your builds and strengthen your toughness against enemy attacks through various buffs like slow-time, double jump, and more. Cyberware has become more important because it is now your main source of armor. Most clothing, aside from appropriate ones like military vests and helmets, no longer have stat bonuses are are now purely cosmetic. \n\nThe 2.0 update introduced vehicular combat so some (not all, importantly) cars now come equipped with weaponry that can be fired while driving. You can now shoot small guns while driving as well. There are now police chases and many more patrolling officers wandering the streets everywhere you look, although regrettably, there AI can be very immersion-breaking in which crimes they seem to choose to tackle.\n\nThis is starting to sound like patch notes for 2.0, so I'll just say most of the gameplay revamps were a welcome fix. \n\n[h1]GRAPHICS/PERFORMANCE:[/h1]\n[b]REVIEWER'S PC SPECS [/b]\n\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [td]CPU[/td]\n        [td]Ryzen 5 5600[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]GPU[/td]\n        [td]RX 6800 XT 16GB[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]RAM[/td]\n        [td]16GB 3200 CL16[/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]\n\nCyberpunk 2077 is rather pretty sometimes. Most of the time, the scenes of Night City are colorful, vibrant, diverse, and aesthetically pleasing. The setting of Night City feels very fleshed out; character models look great, the advertisements covering the city are fun, the people all look futuristic with their cyber implants and funky outfits, etc.\n\nMy main criticism is the game's laughably low draw distance, and it hasn't improved since the original release. When you are driving around in any vehicle at a reasonable speed, objects in the not-too-far distance just appear out of thin air just in time for you to pass them by. It is the one thing that just breaks my immersion of the game's world.\n\nI did not experience any significant crashes or bugs that broke the game or ruined my experience. The bugs I did find were harmless like enemy ragdoll physics or NPC cars just vanishing in the street when colliding with each other. \n\nI had a 'fine' experience playing at 1440P High settings with the listed specs. My framerate fluctuated between about 60 to 100 FPS depending on the location in the city. \n\n[h1]STORY:[/h1]\n•You are V, a mercenary in Night City. After a heist goes unexpected, you end up with the ghost of a former terrorist in your head who will eventually erase you from your body and take it over for himself. You are running on borrowed time and need to figure out how to save yourself before it is too late.\n\n[h1]STRENGTHS:[/h1]\n•The new perks I did play around with are rather fun. I invested into blades and throwing weapons and enjoyed tossing knives at my enemies' heads, dashing into groups with my katana, zipping around them while slowing down time for them but not me, and zipping out to safety to throw more knives from safety. It felt very high-risk, high-reward.\n\n•The streamlining of inventory usage, weapons, and upgrading items is a welcome change. It is much easier to distinguish the strength of weapons based on rarity & strength (e.g. + vs ++), and simplifying healing items and grenades into a resource with a cooldown is nice to get cut down on inventory management.\n\n•Night City overall is a nice setting to play around in. The streets look busy and populated, there are tall buildings everywhere, and it feels like a 'believable' place.\n\n•Gunplay is good; there are various guns for each type (e.g. revolvers, rifles, etc.) and you can also play around with smart weapons which auto-target enemies or tech weapons which can be charged up and can damage enemies behind cover.\n\n[h1]WEAKNESSES:[/h1]\n•It still baffles me how this game was designed to be played in a first-person perspective, and yet there is such a wide amount of designed content that bolsters a third-person perspective including the character creation itself, the hundreds of clothing items, and third-person driving perspectives. Like, okay I'll make my V look cool to take one picture in photo mode, but then what?\n\n•Police AI is wack. I can sometimes start attacking 'police-wanted' enemies with no repercussions like usual, and then sometimes when I start attacking them I get a police-wanted level when I didn't harm any civilian. Also, if I am being attacked by criminals and run toward a cop on the street, most of the time that cop would not even react to do his/her job and just continue walking straight ahead as they were. \n\n•Car handling still feels meh. There are so many sharp corner turns littered around the city and most vehicles just don't negotiate these turns well without slowing down to a crawl.\n\n•Keanu Reeves's performance as Johnny Silverhand is pretty bad. 99% of the time, he just speaks in one tone of voice. Idk if this was a voice direction or recording issue but it was difficult to feel or empathize with him. \n\n•Quests are weird; you might get an optional incentive to do a job (e.g. don't get into combat/don't get spotted), but the payment for the incentive is generally not enticing enough to do. The bonus I would've gotten for say, not getting into combat, isn't as much as the sum total I would receive from selling all of the guns of the dead enemies in the quest area. Also, even though there is some 'dressing' on top of them, many quests just amount to \"go to X and clear it out\" which isn't very interesting.\n\n[h1]NUMERIC SCORE (if you care):[/h1]\n7/10\n\nGood RPG w/ good story; held back by technical issues lingering since release\n\nCyberpunk 2077 launched as a technical jankfest. It took 3 years, but at least the game has been updated to become decent with less jank across the board and to CDPR's credit, most of their fixes have been welcome improvements. \n\n[quote] Checkbox reviews are lazy copy & paste bullsh*t.

                "review": "Cyberpunk genre - whether it’s a game, movie or anime - has always been eye opening for me. Whenever I consume CyberPunk content, it just makes sense. It usually looks distopian and maybe too much, but you KNOW it might come to that, from where the world is going now. All these movies, games, shows, books - they’re trying to warn us upon a dark future man. But this game? It takes the cake, WITH a cherry on top. \n\nUnlike your average story, here in Night City, sh*t is... bleak. Walk around in NC for 10 minutes, you WILL get depressed. And me personally, I love when the content creators do that. You know, give them vibes. Some games TRY to give you a message, something to understand, but they fall short. CP2077 doesn’t shy away from anything. They have an alive city with living breathing people with their own stories in it. They had a vision for a depressive world, they made that world reality and told their story. It just simply DOESN’T. HOLD. BACK. You will see anything and everything uncensored, like a raw BD. Sh*t makes you question the very core of humanity.\n\nI’m not a believer in God, but IF it exists, it left Night City a long time ago. Wherenever and whenever you take a walk in the streets of the massive glowing neon concrete maze, the ’seven sins’ will follow you with each step. Depending on which area you are in the city, you can see NPC’s walking around aimlessly drunk, high, od’d in a dark alley full of garbage - or folk with their beautiful, elegant clothing and shiny cyberware and expensive cars. Thanks to the superb animations, it will feel like you’re actually there. I don’t know how many hours I’ve spent, just walking around, taking screenshots and... absorbing everything, listening to the stories told by the locals. I won’t get into deets because that would fill up an entire data shard. It’s a dark world with dark tales, and it WILL seem familiar. Well duh, some of these things, concepts and places already exist today, as we come close to the end of 2023. Let the consumerism flow through you, my choom.\n\nMy only two complaints about the game will be;\n1- Main story proceeds too fast. Considering the short burn of the main quests; side quests and other exploration feels like a waste of time because well..[spoiler]you’re dying[/spoiler]. Not that they’re bad or boring, in fact they’re very well written and fun to complete. I don’t care if I have to klep some gonk’s wheels or exterminate the members of a gang that’s harassing the locals, so long as eddies and loot keep coming. It's biz as usual. But it’s just that.. you can’t shake the feeling of pressure \"man I should proceed the main story\". A simple solution would be to include [i]*wait X days till you get a response from A person to move on with the quest*[/i]. Game already has this in some quests, just thinking the wait time should have been longer so you could explore without thinking about breaking the immersion.\n\n2- I like Keanu Reeves well enough. But man, he was suck a gonk pick for Johnny Silverhand. His voice and facial expressions simply can NOT surpass a certain point, from my experience with his movies. Keanu is the typa guy to actor quiet fellas - Johnny was a legendary rebel rocker that took a stance against the entire establisment, including gigantic corpos. He’s supposed to be a loud, arrogant as*hole. Keanu simply does NOT possess the kind of «oomph» to impersonate such a choom in my opinion. Even though most of the time I agree with the visions and ideas of Silverhand, the performance that’s offered by Reeves simply lacks the enthusiasm for me to go \"f*ck yea, let’s go burn some corpo sh*t down\". Welp.\n\nBut nevertheless, experience this beautifully crafted universe for yourself choom. Get that Archer out the garage, chrome the f*ck up, bring out your preem steel from your stash, build your street cred - and most importantly: Don’t let Night City chew and spit you out... [b]IF[/b] you can.",

                "review": "I pre-ordered this game and got the \"yellow screen of delay\" twice in 2020. 3 years later , I can confidently say that this is my top game dethroning The Witcher 3. That itself is a huge statement. The Japanese word  \"Kintsugi\" perfectly describes this games journey in terms of development and fixes. The combat overhaul, fixes and changes throughout the entire game has completely turned the game around. Don't get me wrong even with the bugs and glitches I still liked the game but now it's just fucking amazing. I was blessed to be able to play the entirety of Cyberpunk 2077 including the DLC at 4K with RTX Path Tracing on. \n\nPROS\n-BEST looking game hands down no contest. RTX path tracing setting is just fucking insane.\n-High levels of immersion. Just driving/walking around seeing/hearing advertisements is breathtaking. (graphics/world design elements play a huge part and almost no loading screens at all)\n-Thoughtful, believable and relatable characters that generally don't lack depth\n-The voice acting/animations are lively and passionate for the most part (Female V > Male V ,both are great but fem V voice acting is way better)\n-Stories that are very engaging, exciting, and thought provoking (Made me feel depressed a few times at the end of my play-throughs)\n-Multiple endings that can vastly differ from one another based on your decisions and relationships. (They really had a nice way of summarising this in the end credits. The Expansion/DLC can tie greatly into the main story ending too which is cool)\n-Great gun play, cool/uniquely designed weapons and body-augments that make you feel right in with the Cyperpunk world/theme. (I will always be a sucker for Mantis Blades)\n-Amazing expansion/DLC that's pretty much what \"Blood and Wine\" is to the Witcher 3 if not better \n-Music sounds amazing from cut scenes to radio stations. Very fitting to the theme/setting but can subjective to ones taste\n\nCONS\n-Very demanding graphical requirement if you want to truly experience max settings RTX on (100% worth IMO)\n-First person perspective focused\n-There are still bugs and some clunky-ness that can bring you out of immersion for a bit but far from what it was at launch.\n-I love Keanu Reeves but voice acting for Johnny Silverhand can be hit or miss at times though mostly great. (I just don't see/hear him as a rocker rebel terrorist naturally,feels forced at times IMO)\n-Driving is good but can be better still even after the updates\n-Difficulty scaling feels off. Easy feels like story only mode. Normal feels like Easy. Hard feels like Normal. Very Hard feels like Hard. Doesn't ruin the fun just expectations.\n\nAfter 3 years of ups and downs for Cyberpunk 2077 , I finally got a happy and non-depressive ending to this game. \n\nThanks for reading my review :)",

Not exactly sure why they made every ending unsatisfactory, but I'm guessing it's because they knew negative things impact us more, hence some would say those are great endings, but it's actually the opposite, since everyone abuses this tactic nowadays it's somewhat stale at this point, at least for me. Still, it's worth playing for all the rest so it gets a plus overall, but I wish they didn't screw it up when you're 99% done with the game.\n\nBest way I could describe it in a quote is \"It is possible to commit no mistakes and still lose.

Improved and featuring all-new free additional content, customize your character and playstyle as you take on jobs, build a reputation, and unlock upgrades. The relationships you forge and the choices you make will shape the story and the world around you. Legends are made here. The game became a masterpiece after several updates. Decided to come back since DLC was released. The Phantom Liberty is one of the kind of expansion you will find on the market right now due to the bullshit micro-transactions and laziness of the gaming industry. CD Project Red is a different kind of company. They indeed fail players and the community, but they rise up by making the best game ever made in the setting of the future. The weapon system is incredible, knives, katanas, guns and so and so on! Still, the distance view is .... with carton cars... Overall, missions are great, Johhny is well Johny!!! The characters are well-written! Recommend! Glory To Ukraine! Long Live Belarus! Thank you so much CDPR For Ukranian subtitiles! \n\nCyberpunk 2077 - гэта прыгодніцкая ролевая гульня з адкрытым светам, дзеянне якой адбываецца ў мегаполісе Найт-Сіці, дзе вы гуляеце за найміта-кіберпанка, уцягнутага ў барацьбу за выжыванне. Палепшаны і з абсалютна новым бясплатным дадатковым змесцівам, наладжвайце свайго характару і стыль гульні, бяручыся за працу, ствараючы рэпутацыю і адкрываючы мадэрнізацыі. Адносіны, якія вы наладжваеце, і выбар, які вы робіце, будуць фармаваць гісторыю і свет вакол вас. Тут складаюцца легенды. Гульня стала шэдэўрам пасля некалькіх абнаўленняў. Вырашыў вярнуцца пасля выхаду DLC. Phantom Liberty - адно з тых пашырэнняў, якія вы зараз знойдзеце на рынку з-за лухты мікратранзакцый і ляноты гульнявой індустрыі. CD Project Red - гэта зусім іншая кампанія. Яны сапраўды падводзяць гульцоў і супольнасць, але яны падымаюцца, ствараючы лепшую гульню, калі-небудзь зробленую ў сеттинге будучыні. Сістэма зброі неверагодная, нажы, катаны, пісталеты і гэтак далей! Тым не менш, выгляд здалёк .... з кардоннымі машынамі ... У цэлым, місіі выдатныя, Джоні - гэта добра, Джоні!!! Героі добра прапісаны! Рэкамендуем! Слава Ўкраіні! Жыве Беларусь! Дзякуй CDPR за Ўкраінскія субтытры! \n\nCyberpunk 2077 — це пригодницька рольова гра з відкритим світом у мегаполісі Найт-Сіті, де ви граєте за найманця-кіберпанка, який бере участь у боротьбі за виживання «зроби або помри».

It was that bad when the game released initially.\n\nYears passed, with 2.0 update and a new DLC Expansion, finally the game is in a good state and very playable. Some features that was promised aren't there still, but if you don't care/don't follow the whole drama, Cyberpunk 2077 is a fun action RPG.\n\nA lot of build for different playstyles, plenty of choices you have to make that will affect the ending, and a beautiful visual on top of it. Not the best story, definitely not as deep as Baldur's Gate 3 for example, but it's still fun.\n\nBuy it when the game is on sale and you'll get a really enjoyable Action RPG game with about 30 hours of playtime.",

                "review": "[h1] Cyberpunk 2077: A Phoenix Rising [/h1]\n\nLet's talk about Cyberpunk 2077, a game that's been on a rocky journey since its less-than-stellar launch in December 2020. Fast forward to September 21, 2023, and the game just received its largest update yet, coinciding with the release of the Phantom Liberty DLC. I'll dive into that expansion in another review, but for now, let's discuss the game-changing 2.0 update.\n\nWhen Cyberpunk 2077 initially hit the scene, it was far from the polished gem players were promised. The police system was laughably lackluster, vehicular combat was missing, dynamic chase scenes were absent, and the crowd AI was, well, as dumb as bricks. To top it off, the game was plagued with bugs and glitches reminiscent of Bethesda's Skyrim at launch.\n\nBut credit where it's due. Over the past three years, CD Projekt Red has rolled up its sleeves and worked tirelessly to turn this mess into something resembling a playable game. I, for one, recommended it from the start, thanks to its engaging story and stunning visuals. Still, it became evident that the game's true potential lay in next-gen consoles like the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, leaving last-gen players in the dust.\n\nNow, the 2.0 update has arrived, heralding a transformation of the game that invites those who abandoned it to give it a second (or third) chance. I've spent a day diving back into Night City, and here are my thoughts on what's better, what's worse, and what's just different.\n\n[b] The Good: [/b]\n\nCrafting Freedom: No more being tied down by the Technical skill for crafting. Now, everyone can craft what they want if they have the components and blueprints. This freedom means you're not forced into crafting builds just to get decent gear. Plus, there are fewer component requirements due to changes in the armor system.\n\nWardrobe Sanity: Say goodbye to that immersion-breaking tactic of piling on random clothing to maximize damage resistance. Now, clothing doesn't offer armor benefits. Damage resistance is solely from your cybernetic enhancements.\n\nRevamped Perk System: All your perks are refunded, and they now belong to a completely new skill tree. Abilities are more dynamic, including air dashes, vehicle hacking, adrenaline rushes, and cyberpsychosis berserk mode. The freedom to refund and experiment with various builds is a breath of fresh air.\n\nEnhanced Cybernetics: The range of cybernetics you can equip gets a significant boost. You can even upgrade them to higher tiers. V's abilities are capped by their Body score, but the Edgerunner perk lets you exceed that at the cost of brief cyberpsychosis.\n\nImproved AI: Night City's criminals and foes are no longer as dim-witted. This elevates the challenge and makes encounters a lot more engaging.\n\nTerrifying Cops: The much-maligned Night City police are now a force to be reckoned with. They don't give up easily, and Max-Tac units can give even the strongest Vs a run for their money.\n\nBalanced Netrunning: No more feeling like a psychic wizard as a Netrunner. It's now harder for you, and easier for enemies to detect you. Breach Protocols can't be used on enemies either.\n\nVehicular Mayhem: Vehicle combat, car chases, and tire-shooting are finally here. It breathes life into the extensive vehicle collection.\n\nPersonalized V: You can now change your character's appearance, a feature that should've been there from the beginning, given the game's focus on transhumanism.\n\n[b] The Neutral: [/b]\n\nScaling NPCs: NPCs now scale to your level, aligning more with the tabletop game. It cranks up the difficulty but in a way that keeps you challenged throughout Night City's mayhem.\n\nRipperdoc Uniformity: While it's nice that all Ripperdocs offer the same cybernetics, some miss the immersion of searching for unique enhancements in different places. On the bright side, you can now deal with Fingers without consequences.\n\nUI Tweaks: The journal and cell phone receive minor changes to declutter. It's not a game-changer, but it's a welcome improvement.\n\nNew Radio Stations: Three new stations add to the soundtrack. Personal taste comes into play here; more variety in Night City's music would've been great. But one station features original fan-made music, and Idris Elba is on the airwaves.\n\n[b] The Bad: [/b]\n\nCrafting Components: Vendors no longer sell crafting components, extending the game's lifespan but making it a tad less convenient. Buying up components beforehand now seems like a missed opportunity.\n\nCloth Looting: Say farewell to the \"crazy murder hobo with a wardrobe of the dead\" era. NPCs no longer drop clothing, meaning you can't loot your victims' stylish outfits.\n\nBugs: Some new bugs have crept in. Small issues like getting stuck in conversations and voice dropouts during missions need addressing.\n\n[b] Conclusion: [/b]\n\nThe 2.0 update is nothing short of impressive, unleashing the game's untapped potential. Better police and enemy AI alone make it worthwhile. The shift away from clothing as an essential part of the loot cycle is a positive change, reducing clutter and making the game more fun. It was already great due to its story and design, but now it's simply better in every aspect. Those who prefer a challenge will thrive, but it's a shame that last-gen players won't experience this update.\n\nIf you have a current-gen console or a capable PC, now is the ideal time to dive into Cyberpunk 2077. It's improved across the board. Starting fresh instead of continuing from an old save might offer a new perspective on Night City.\n\nThis phoenix of a game has risen from the ashes, and it's worth soaring with.",

Bought the game again when patch 1.6 came out but only played half way thru. With 2.0 I finally decided to finish the game once and for all and started a new game from scratch, and I am so glad I did. This game is just so fun to play now. With all the bug fixes and improvements made to the graphics and gameplay, this game is finally the masterpiece CDPR set out to make in the first place. I haven't played a game so good in a long long time. The world is immersive, the game play is fun, and the story is just amazing. I just can't stop playing. There are still some bugs here and there, but none of them a deal breaker. Shame that they are not making any more DLCs after Phantom LIberty. \n\nCyberpunk 2077 is one of the best games ever made and is definitely a must play!!!",

Was it worth forsaking the community's goodwill, spending 3 years trying to fix their game and then essentially re-releasing it again? Thats a question only CDPR can answer. \n\nThe game follows the equivalent law of exchange. What I mean is, when its good, the good stuff is godlike. But when its not good, that stuff will rip you out of your immersion and make you re-evaluate your opinions on this game. \n\nThere are bugs and glitches but none that are game breaking. Atleast, not anymore. \n\n It holds up as a decent RPG, a good shooter and a dense and detail packed open world game. The visuals are unlike anything else you've seen and hold up even at less than optimal settings. Thats a major achievement. Plus, if you are one of those ballers with PCs made to fight God, you can push it to the limit with Path Tracing Overdrive and brag about your 99% FPS data and hyper realistic screenshots on your PCmasterrace forums. \n\nThe cherry on top is the vibrant modding scene. \n\nSo. After all this. Is this game perfect? No. Should you buy it? Yes.",

But it's still not what most people expected it would be.\n\n2.0 addressed basically every major issue people had with previous versions of the game, mainly focusing on gameplay updates and completely overhauling things, and that's good!! Some noticeably good changes were:\n- Driving feels good now and Jackie's Arch isn't the only viable vehicle to use in every situation;\n- Every skill feels fun now, building them feels viable and cool as hell;\n- Cyberware are more powerful, but at the same time more accurate to what they're supposed to be in-lore;\n- The NCPD isn't a joke anymore;\n- Numerous game-breaking glitches have been patched;\n\nHowever. How. Ever...\nThere are still many fundamental things that could not be addressed in 2.0. The story itself, and the way missions play have clearly been designed for the rudimentary systems from version 1.x. It's not always evident, but when it is, it's REALLY evident. \n\nIf you hadn't played this game before and wanted to try it out for the first time, expecting a AAA first person Cyberpunk RPG, you're in for an incredible game!\nIf you're coming to the game after having watched Edgerunners and expected a similar experience, you're not getting that.\nIf you're coming to the game after having seen all the teasers and trailers from past E3's, you're not getting that game.\nWhat you're getting is a solid AAA RPG experience with some of the best storytelling I've seen, one hell of a cool setting, with satisfying mechanics and hours of worthwhile content.\n\nAll that being said, you still can't dual-wield guns like wtf CDPR you had one job",

                "review": "TLDR, love the practice or hate it, CDPR did what we all assumed was gonna happen: release the game as a piece of crap to tremendous backlash, then turn it into a shockingly good title near 3 years down the line. Leave your negative reviews in principle if you will, but it's disingenuous to say I don't recommend this game after the 2.0 update.\n\nMy first run-through, a few patches after launch, I found myself enamored with the aesthetics of the game. Its strong points were clear: the world, the story it had to tell, the density and scale of Night City (after the most egregious bugs were ironed out). Its weak points were also clear: uninspired character building, lackluster combat with questionable enemy AI and balance issues galore.\n\n2.0 brought the weak points to parity with the strong points and I really don't have anything to complain about with cyberpunk anymore. I had a good time clearing the game the first time around, enjoying the world between sprints of carving through crowds of dumb, broken (technically, not balance-wise) enemies with the occasional boss fight. I am having a [u]great[/u] time now bouncing between ambient enemy packs, side missions, and main missions, devouring as much content as possible as a badass, bullet-timing, shot-reflecting, double-jumping, invisible-at-will cyber-samurai. \n\nThe previously wooden perk tree full of garbage like \"Do/take/find X% more/less Y\" is now absolutely oozing with amazing mechanical boons that come in to play very quickly. Reflex. Cool. Technical. Intelligence. Body. Each of the five are now extremely well-defined with three different branches of major and minor perks to flesh out your character, and while some things won't work as well as you want them to, you'll find a shocking amount of synergy between trees of the different stats. I'm constantly impressed with the different playstyles I see my friends and members of the community trying out, and how much longevity throughout the game that you get out of these builds at all difficulties (assuming you do your side content to acquire solid gear, crafting parts, and XP). \n\nIt's just plain good. I'm disappointed we've come to the end of content for this game, a game to which most of us at some point I'm sure said \"ugh, if only it had more time in the oven.\" You hear that?

                "review": "I love this game so much. I really feel enthralled by Night City and the way it creates a feeling I cannot get anywhere else; whether in reality or other games. I am a very huge fan of the Cyberpunk genre, and in saying this, find that Cyberpunk 2077 does an amazing job at bringing this world to life. I have never written a review on anything, so shout out to Cyberpunk 2077 for being my very first.\n\nFrom the very first heist with Jackie to the new Phantom Liberty update, this game makes me test my own moral compass and ethics. It makes me contemplate such deep ideas like life and death; the future of AI and technology; the grim realities, harsh truths, tough sacrifices and deadly consequences one choice can entail. I wonder to myself, time and time again, as Dexter DeShawn asked V in the prologue, \"Would you rather live in peace... or go down in a blaze of glory?\". The writing in the game is phenomenal, the characters are all unique and the world is just full of so much life and depth that I wish even some of the side missions never ended. While the lore of Cyberpunk is something that fascinates me outside of this game, it is easy to draw parallels between this futuristic dystopia to the one we just might be headed towards - the consequences of war, overpopulation, resource culmination, corporate takeovers, worldwide poverty, famine, all the way to global pandemics (lol, been there) - just to name a few! It really makes you think.\n\nThe huge world of Night City is sprawled before you with so much intricacy and attention to detail that it becomes breathtaking. From the coruscated landscape of Japantown, to the street-art and zest of Heywood and The Glen, to the sheer megalophobia the giant buildings make you feel in Corpo Plaza, all the way to the rustic aesthetic of the Badlands... and now the run-down state of Dogtown... they all feel like they're own worlds! But it's not - it's all NC, choom, and we're livin' in it. Running around and discovering new hidden gems, side quests and taunting gangs in localised areas only to find cool knick-knacks all around, becomes an enthralling pastime full of life no matter how many hours you have in the game already (source: trust me choom). The game has also helped me on a personal level to tackle some of my own fears, like social anxiety, and certain anxieties in general (without going into too much detail) - it really takes you there; contemplating if it's really worth to withdraw out of fear of being zeroed, or to just experience the outside world with friends and family to make memories, knowing life's fragility and appreciating it all anyway? From seeing cases of Cyberpsychosis, to the insinuated evil that happens at the Biotechnica Flats, to even conspiracies we uncover under the Peralez side-quest... it just makes you think and reconsider, over and over. At least it does for me. The multiple endings (and the new added ones with the Phantom Liberty update) take this into consideration. The Human Experience is so real in this game, unlike any other game I've ever seen or heard of. And the different options of builds each play-through make the game refreshing time and time again as well. This is currently my third play-through and wow... with almost 300 hours on it (and practically 90 hours right now in the last two weeks), I'm honestly never bored in any way, shape or form.\n\nTo give context, I first purchased this game as a pre-order before the final launch, keeping up to date with CD Project Red's news and announcements (including the delays, the \"scandals,\" etc.). Now I will say, I had very little bugs during my initial play-through personally, so I never understood the horrors one could say many others faced. At the time, being late 2020, my PC was brand new and sported the latest GPU available to NVIDIA. So I essentially experienced glitching and jank at a very minimal level. As it has progressed to now (late 2023), my PC has stayed the same, and I frequently find myself now crashing and reporting repeatedly to no avail unfortunately. I definitely feel bad for those that avoided the game due to this reason initially, and the bad rep the project received, because they would have never submersed themselves into Night City and the world that CDPR and Mike Pondsmith created. I have always been terribly devastated by the lack of love the game was rewarded with initially due to this - making it a game I do not share tales of with my friends and mutuals because they either chose to refund, or were just too outraged to consider purchasing the game. But oh, how much they're missing out on is indescribable!\n\nThe real criticisms that I can notably make are probably around character customisation - it just feels so restricting as someone who wants to style my Valerie in trendier outfits. I know that's not the point of the game, and I can certainly make-do with what I have now, but that's just my own opinion. I wish it could incorporate the option for third person as well, or even a co-op aspect to enjoy with my partner while we contemplate our ethical decision-making that this game ignites discourse on. On the same note, I was pretty bummed out that CDPR never implemented MMO into this game, but don't blame them. V is a lone merc for a reason, I guess (shoutout to David Martinez and the Edgerunners crew). Maybe these things can be in a separate game - a prequel or sequel - because as of now, I understand why they never went through with it. It would make more sense anyway with a follow-up game that utilises their new engine as well. So no real issues for me there, it just would be a more collective experience with friends is all. But honestly, going back to my first note, I just want more cool clothing because I am a lover of fashion in my own life, so the game would feel more personalised to me. There are a few other encounters and experiences in-game that spark questions in my head like; why does Songbird think I owe her so much (and why does betraying her turn Cyberpunk 2077 to a literal hour-long horror game - eep, not personally a fan of that one, lol)? Why do Joytoy encounters exist with nothing to add to the plot, really? What about flying cars? Why aren't radio channels updated with more new music, like how Rockstar updates their radio for GTA V? Just a few from the top of my head, anyway.\n\nNevertheless, I am truly in love with this game and constantly awed by it. I just want more, more, more. And I want to finalise this review by thanking CDPR for this piece of interactive art wholeheartedly. From the Night City-wide lingo and slang, to just the vibes all over, there's really nowhere else I'd rather be besides Night City (I guess besides where I am now, comfy, in my PJ's and sitting on my PC way past midnight while I type this). I just have a whole new appreciation for the game and even my own personal circumstances. To just have the ability to turn this game on, unwind after work and time-skip IRL by digging hours deep into this game is a privilege I wish others had, too. Being passionate and loving something has felt near-impossible after my fanatic teenage years, so it's safe to say that I'm also simply grateful for this dystopian joyride Cyberpunk 2077 has taken me on. The new Phantom Liberty update for 2.0 (and as of making this post, 2.01 now) is what I strongly believe the initial launch should've been to really sway audiences to cherish this game just as much as I do. It really feels complete now with this update and patch. And the IP, after the release of Edgerunners, is just so powerful too. I am so keen on Project Orion to come out, and hopefully with a season 2 of Edgerunners (with a new cast, of course), but in the meantime I'll keep playing. Thank you once again to all the chooms at CDPR. Please never stop doing what you do!",

(in fact i love this game so much i learned some people know me just as \"that cyberpunk fan\" as i find myself getting pinged on discord everytime the game is mentioned)\ni started playing close to release and i had such a blast even then!!! now its even more fun!!!! the combat can be soo flawless when you find your perfect build!! and dont even get me started on the story and characters! i spent countless of hours and nights overthinking the game's philosophy, lore and decisions. The characters feel so authentic, like real people, and it truly depends on you whether you end up loving them or hating them (yeah, some people in the game are real a**holes, but i cant help but admire their dedication and reasoning, this game has taught me that deep inside theres some good in everyone)\nim just rambling at this point and i could ramble so much more but what im trying to say is THIS GAME IS AMAZING, THANK YOU EVERYONE THAT WORKED ON IT",

                "review": "A Dystopian Masterpiece\n\nIn the sprawling, neon-lit streets of Night City, Cyberpunk 2077 unfolds its rich tapestry, weaving a narrative and experience that, despite its conspicuous imperfections, manages to captivate and engross. Navigating through the game on the PC, I found myself enveloped in a world where the line between digital and reality beautifully blurs.\n\nCyberpunk 2077 is not merely a game; it's an immersive journey into a meticulously crafted universe. The characters, each with their intricately woven narratives and emotional depth, become entities that transcend their digital origins. From the rebellious spirit of Judy to the stoic yet complex Takemura, every character invites players into their lives, offering a glimpse into their joys, struggles, and stories that feel palpably real.\n\nThe city itself is a character – a vibrant, chaotic, and utterly mesmerizing entity that can enthrall you for hours on end. It's not merely the main storyline that captivates; it's the myriad of subplots, the unexpected adventures, and the spontaneous encounters that truly elevate the Cyberpunk 2077 experience. The game allows you to lose yourself in its expansive world, exploring, connecting, and simply living amidst its urban cacophony.\n\nHowever, the journey is not without its bumps. The most glaring issue lies in the game’s ‘endgame’ – or the lack thereof. Upon concluding the main story, players are thrust back to the pivotal point of no return, left with the option to perpetually replay the final mission. This mechanic, albeit slightly jarring, does not entirely detract from the immersive experience, especially if one chooses to simply return to the vibrant world and explore to their heart's content. Yet, for a select completionist like myself, it introduces a subtle yet persistent dissonance.\n\nMy anticipation for Cyberpunk 2077 was unparalleled, eclipsing the excitement for any other game in my gaming history. While it did not wholly meet the towering expectations – a bar set perhaps impossibly high – it delivered something uniquely special. It wasn’t the flawless experience I had envisioned, but it was a journey that resonated, offering a narrative that was compelling, characters that were genuine, and a world that was enchanting in its complexity and vibrancy. The fact that the game took 2 years to polish is a solid proof of this.\n\nIn reflection, Cyberpunk 2077 is a paradox of perfection and flaw, intertwining impeccable narrative crafting with noticeable technical shortcomings. It wasn’t the epitome of all my gaming hopes, but it was a spectacular adventure that I was far from disappointed in. The story never lost its allure, each mission was a new thrill, and the world was an endless canvas of exploration and interaction.\n\nIn its essence, Cyberpunk 2077 is a masterpiece, beautifully imperfect, and profoundly human.\n\n10/10.",

With that being said, after the 2.0 Update and Phantom Liberty DLC, there is a lot to be said about Night City. Between the well written NPCs that have their own drives and ambitions, Deeply detailed city-scape environment, to an incredible sound track, the game excels on its own merits that only suffers from the false promises at launch. If you play this game on its own merits, its a good FPS with light RPG elements. 8.5/10 in its current state.",

                "review": "I remember doing my first playthrough back during release and being disappointed that it didn't meet the expectations I was hoping for. Sure even back in 2020 the game still had an amazing story and the world was beautiful, but the game had so many issues which made it hard to enjoy the game to its full extent. The 2.0 patch however was exactly what this game needed to really shine, and with this patch I feel this game has cemented itself as one of the best RPGs on the market currently.\n\nFrom a gameplay point of view 2.0 has definitely improved everything a lot, even if it's just small details you definitely do notice a huge difference overall with how the game feels and plays. The story was always good, even back on release and not much had really changed there, but the actual major fixes the game had made it easier to take in and enjoy the story fully. The world is absolutely stunning, and is up there as one of the most beautiful worlds you can explore in any game, night city is a treat to explore, and you will always find something new that will impress you even when you're 50+ hours in. The Phantom liberty DLC feels more like an expansion to the already existing game, but it is genuinely one of the best DLCs/expansions I have played.\n\nOverall I am extremely impressed with how this game has turned around and gone from a game which most people would call below average, to an RPG titan which will be remembered for years to come, hell maybe even decades. Thank you CD PROJEKT RED for caring and not abandoning the game like so many other studios would have done. You are truly breathtaking.",

                "review": "Finally writing a positive review for this game, since even though I liked the story and the world since launch, I still had major gripes with it. Most of it being unbalanced gameplay systems and lack of QoL features, which made me play most of the content in pure stealth with no weapons or offensive abilities. Otherwise on the hardest difficulty, it was always a mix of it either being unfair with everything killing you instantly, or having overpowered weapons and abilities that made the game a joke. Add to that the ability to cheese the game by spamming healing items.\n\nAfter the recent 2.0 update, I can't really find anything to complain about. Everything has been fixed and changed up, the gameplay actually being fun and engaging with there being more build variety than the game has ever had.\n\nIt's also more optimized now and runs smoother than ever, although it comes with the downside of not being able to change it in the settings. Surrounding textures can now be unrecognizably low and models having lower LoDs in general, making it difficult to appreciate the small details. Photo mode doesn't render in more detail either, so it's sort of a permanent trade for more performance.\n\nAll in all, it has now become a solid game that I can fully recommend.",

                "review": "Guess I'll finally write a review for this. As much flak as this game took when it first came out (and deservedly so), they really turned it around. Even the new DLC is pretty great. Honestly, the graphics, game play, and story-line are A+. Even the spin-offs on TV were stunningly good. And they've reduced the bugs to a minimum (especially the game-breaking ones) while optimizing this beast quite a bit. And the bugs that are left are, imo, hilarious and oddly endearing. Hats off to the final product. I hope CDPR keeps up this level of quality and can even go beyond it someday. This game is immersive, a far cry from a lot of other games out there, including and especially Starfield. I'd tell Bethesda to take notes, but Todd Howard doesn't care in the slightest and he's very outwardly forward and proud about that. The downhill slide of gaming started with EA, then Activision, then they closed 2K Austrailia (I mean I wouldn't run my cash-cow (Borderlands) into the ground like I developed the same response to money that rabies victims end up with water, but hey that's why they don't pay me to be CEO I guess), and now Bethesda has firmly cemented itself into that circle of awfulness. I genuinely hope CDPR stays above the others and continues to shine. I think we're down to CDPR and Fromsoft now as far as AAA gaming goes. Not sure why, but I feel like this might be one of the last truly great games ever. Greed and utter submission to shareholders have laid waste to creativity and joy and the casualties have been immense. I mean who predicted Halo end-over-ending at mach 1 down a mountain of cactus? I sure didn't see that coming. Any who, hope I'm wrong and that this isn't one of the dyeing breaths of video gaming.",

                "review": "This review includes the 2.x patch and the Phantom Liberty DLC\n\nThis game has many glitches, bugs, issues. When you immerse yourself into the story, countless player build opportunities, free roaming side gigs it's easy to forgive the issues. The amount of detail in each and every corner of this game is unlike anything I have ever seen before. The gun play is fantastic and gives you dozens of ways to play the way YOU want to play. The blade play is great but needs some polishing. I tend to use guns mostly in addition to trowing knives when trying to be stealth. It's impossible for me to tell you what style of combat is best because they did such a great job of making it customization so you can play how you want. \n\nPhantom Liberty is the best DLC I have ever played. What I am about to say it tough because in the last paragraph I told you how amazing CP2077 is. The Phantom Liberty story and game play, IN MY OPTION, are actually better than the base game, an already fantastic game. Dogtown (the new area added in the DLC) is one of the most stunning and detailed areas I have ever seen in any game. \n\nThey knew that the base game story was a little linear so they made YOU the story writer. Choices have real and lasting consequences that make you stop and think. Some choices are so rough I had to pause the game and think about it. The life and death of you're crew can lay in your hands based on who choose to trust, who is telling the truth? Who may be lying? Does either choice have a positive outcome? Is it possible to have a happy ending? It reminds me of Detroit Become human. After I finished my story, i went to youtube to see other outcomes and was BLOWN AWAY by what was possible. It was inconceivable to me in my story that those things were possible.  \n\nYou will see bugs, you will see glitches but you won't regret overlooking them to play this fascinating game.",

But buggy here and there. But it was good fun. Suppose they did not promise the things they did. I just released the game later on since it needed more time. It may have ended better overall.\n\nWe now have a fantastic DLC that adds more life to the game and even bigger choices. That is all I can say about the DLC, so this review doesn't spoil anything. The missions are fantastic. However, one path is more flesh out than the other.\n\nNow that I have fully completed the game, I feel happy that I did. Even doing the ncpd stuff is harsh to do in every block. It's for people who want the game at 100%. But damm why are there so many? It cost me some good time. In the case of a game, wasting time to spoil you in their universe is a good thing. \n\nI only wished it was more like a gig. since these are up there with the side missions.\n\nThe endings you have are a natural hard choice. I remember from the beginning, I picked the Aldecaldos ending so I could be with Panam. It's still the best ending, to be honest. I'm not going into details, but damm, don't some choices make you regret them, especially when you get calls from everyone saying wtf? Why are you not picking up?\n\nAll I can say is in its current form. It's an excellent game. It was a great experience, and I hope to see a new one that continues v's adventure. Do I hope for more... human factors in V's talking?\n\nDamm, can he be boring sometimes? You can't have everything, can you?\n\nSo now that I have wasted your time reading this.\n\nfirst state 7/10\n2.1 state 9/10\n\nI can't wait to see what CD Projekt Red does now with it. They put in a significant investment. Let's see what it brings them.",

                "review": "This game is an interesting one to review, given the conversation around it. As someone who played it two years after release, here are my thoughts on what the game is like in its current state, without any hype or rage attached to it. In short: I was pleasantly surprised. Like, a lot.\n\nI picked this game up for cheap with low expectations. I expected something flawed but fun in a mindless way like Far Cry but I couldn't have been any more wrong. Cyberpunk 2077 is a game made with genuine love and care, with impressive attention to detail. The game was much more immersive and RPG-like than I thought it'd be, and the characters and story were top-notch. It reminded me a lot of Deus Ex and Fallout: New Vegas.\n\nI think this game deserves special praise for being a AAA open world with zero padding. That is, you can ignore all of the side content and railroad through the main quest and finish the game in 10 hours if you really want to. The side quests are also extremely good though, and I was drawn to doing them solely because I found the characters and world fascinating. I think Night City deserves praise as an open world that feels hand-crafted and intrinsically interesting; nothing in it felt like mindless copied-and-pasted content to me.\n\nOf course, your mileage may vary. This game is not GTA or The Elder Scrolls, and I think a lot of the disappointment that people have with this game even now comes from this fact. The driving isn't great, the pedestrian AI is basic, and you can't go into every single building. But I think that's fine. The game is a story-focused RPG and Night City is just there as the pretty backdrop in between missions. The real meat of this game is the narrative and characters.\n\nFor years I'd been hearing about how CDPR didn't \"deliver on their promises\" but after playing through the whole thing, I can't really say I feel that way. I had a blast and my only true gripe with the game is that it's unfortunately still riddled with bugs. You won't encounter anything game-breaking, but it is worth mentioning, so keep that in mind. Regardless of that though, I was still pleasantly surprised, and this is probably my favorite game I played this year. Long live Night City.",

The soundtrack is varied and high quality. The writing in this game stands out. Even the 'gigs' in the game all have some unique twist to them. Really a great cyberpunk experience in 2023.",

Yeah, definitely. Did they flatline the game? Almost. If it wasn't for the love and dedication of the developers of CD PROJEKT RED (and yeah, they might be corpos), then the vidiot would definitely be zeroed.\n\nThere were a lot of kickers who had issues upon release that stirred up a lot of heat. And yeah, there were some issues, but when you can just hide behind a handle and spam away on the net without a care in the world, the complaints stacked up and didn't give the vidiot its due justice. When you want to create the best, there is some gonks out there who will tear you down.\n\nSure, there were a few netrunners too who threatened the corpos, but little good that did them. Didn't slow down the developers. They kept pouring time and energy into the game. Fixin' it up and making it flash.\n\nThe developers broke their corpo leash and kept giving to us. Listening to the us chooms instead of those NetNerds who squat their mom's basements. That is why I nominated Cyberpunk 2077 for the Labor of Love in the 2022 Steam Awards. The developers care. A lot. And they continue to prove it by releasing new content, fixes, and polishin' the vidiot like a diamond.\n\nBottom line choom; when you need that escape from deep reality, you can get your fix with Cyberpunk 2077. \n\nIs it worth the eddies? You betcha it is.\n\nAlso, if you haven't eyeballed it yet, go check out the vidflick Cyberpunk: Edgerunners.\n\nGood hunting, choom.",

It's good (enough) now, half off seems fair for the hours you get out of it.[/h1]\n\n[b]Great story![/b] CP77 can really make you contemplate our society and what it could become. I enjoyed what they did with Johnny Silverhand and how your interactions can change your opinions and your outlook.\n\nThe [b]gameplay[/b] was fun and not too challenging, with specialisations for each every playstyle. I was really impressed by the design of the levels and how they enable you to choose different approaches (violent, sneaky, hacking, etc.); for instance, in one side mission, you have to take out a target and if your tech ability is high enough, you can enter the neighbouring building and snipe your target from a balcony without even entering enemy territory. \n\nThe game ran [b]relatively stable[/b] on my PC (mid range build from 2016). There were a few crashes and some graphic bug that was easily fixed. So nothing compared to the launch days and it didn't bother me too much.\n\nCP77 has a [b]good length[/b] and will keep completionists busy. The busy-work was ok, but nothing special in terms of \"must play\"-experience.\n\n[i]I enjoyed the game so I can recommend it with a good conscience. They cleaned up most of the critical flaws and it feels like the designers were in it with their hearts. So the whole screw-up phase at launch was rather a publishing/PR issue imho.[/i]",

A couple weeks ago i gave it second chance, and im glad i did.\n\nThe game is by no means bug free, but you won´t run into bugs every 2 meters like back then and the gamebreaking stuff is fixed. I cannot give any insight how performance over time improved, since i build a completly new system in the meantime.\n\nNo story spoilers, but i really like V as a maincharacter. I would suggest to play as female V tho. The female voice-acting is just miles better than the male one. \n\nGreat platform for mods. I advice some mods that lets you interact with more stuff in the world, like streetvendors. Also there are mods that add more stuff like gigs to do.\n\nThis is more a thing of personal preference, but i like the soundtrack alot. It is atleast in my top ten of game OST´s.\n\nWhat i miss is a new game plus feature (doesn´t even need to be overcomplicated, just level enemys to my level), just so i can replay the story again with my souped up V and maybe more things to in general.\n\nPlaying on 3440x1440 with optimized ultra settings with (mixed settings) raytracing  runs pretty well on dlss quality.\nI also checked out FSR, but that one has crazy tearing. Intels xess runs fine tho. System is a 11th gen i7, RTX3080ti, 32Gigaboobs ram for comparisons sake. \n\nAll in all, i like the game, the world, the characters, gameplay loop and so fort.\nCan´t wait for Phantom Liberty to break all my mods again.",

I’ve explored every inch of Night City and the Badlands, and even now I sometimes find stashes of, guns, ammo & items etc that I never found before (usually halfway up a fire escape or down a blind alley I’ve always walked on by lol). I’ve played this game to within an inch of its life, so when I say it’s a good game - IT’S A REALLY GOOD GAME! \n\nDo I have any constructive criticism? Of course I do…\nI wish you could steer the vehicles with the mouse instead of the A+D keys (same as the Borderlands games). I also wish there were more gigs/jobs with Jackie at the beginning. These things are just superficial, but hey. \n\nThe modding community have really stepped up to the plate with this game. There are some REALLY good mods out there. I’ve clocked up over 1200 hrs of game-play thanks to these additions. That’s why I’m looking forward to the Phantom Liberty expansion, because I need start a new playthrough!\n\nFinally, this game is resource hungry. Don’t try installing this on an old, low spec PC and then start complaining about it – the problem isn’t the game, it’s the potato you’re trying to play it on.\n",

[/b]\nIf you expect an in depth RPG with good combat, advanced character customization and crafting, this is not the game for you. \nIf what you want is to dive head first into a deeply immersive world, with vivid characters and fucked up dystopian storylines, you're in for a treat.\n\n[b] PROS :  [/b]\n\n- [u] The world [/u] . Night City is a treat for the eyes, although some zones feel a little lackluster.\n- [u] Characters [/u] . This game has an impressive panel of well animated, well written characters that you want to love or love to hate.\n- [u] Choices [/u] . Every choice isn't impactful, but there is a lot of variety in what you can say and/or do, making different backgrounds worth the new playthrough.\n- [u] Plentiful [/u] . There is a ton to do in the game, from simple repetitive gigs to richly animated and diverse questlines that bring you to every corner of Night City.\n- [u] Visually impressive [/u] .  Holy shit the game is gorgeous, especially during the night time in the middle of the city. It perfectly scratches that itch for a futuristic neon aesthetic. The models are great, whether on guns, swords, cars or other random objects. It all coalesces into a very immersive experience.\n- [u] Braindances [/u] . Vastly underused concept, but every quest that involves them is an absolute treat.\n- [u] Photo mode [/u] . It takes advantage of the gorgeous world, you can do whatever you want with it, and take some great pics if you're into that. Just a cool tool that is easily accessed at all times.\n\n[b] CONS :  [/b]\n\n- [u] Combat [/u] . There are no two ways around it, combat sucks. It feels like skyrim's (which was already poor in 2011) in a game that came out 10 years later. Shooting is clunky, melee is overpowered.\n- [u] Difficulty [/u] . Developers please, are we really so out of ideas in how to implement higher difficulties? I usually play games on the hardest diffulty for a good challenge, but Cyberpunk is still stuck in the primitive stage of HIGHER DIFFICULTY = ENEMIES HAVE A TON MORE HEALTH. When every basic thug needs to be shot 100 times in the head, it only breaks immersion, especially in a game already plagued by poor combat.\n- [u] Driving [/u] . I know it's not exactly fair to compare, but god damn GTAV is coming up on 10 years of life. The driving physics here are rage inducing, and there are only about two vehicles worth giving a damn about in the entire game. Shame, because the cars are so well designed. AVOID CURBS AT ALL COSTS.\n- [u] Menuing [/u] . Primitive UI and UX, nothing more to say. It's annoying, hard to read, feels awful to navigate. You have 3 different buttons to escape 3 different menus, why...\n- [u] Progression [/u] . Whether we're talking weapon and skill progression, which feels unrewarding at best, and downright punishing if you don't invest in crafting and get iconic items too early, or in game/lore progression where your street cred doesn't feel impactful at all, the whole progression system is underwhelming and could use a lot of work. I expect this is an area of the game that will improve drastically with mods.\n\nIn the end, I enjoyed playing the game and completing all the achievements. I got the game during steam sales and it was definitely worth the price I put into it, especially with the modding community coming out with more stuff. \nCyberpunk is a flawed experience, one with its moments of brillance and very high highs, as well as very low lows with broken and uninteresting content at times. \nI'd recommend it if you know what to expect, have a very capable rig, and get it at a reduced cost.",

                "review": "Gosh, where do I even start?\n\nFirst off, if you're looking for a masterpiece, a game without flaws, this ain't it. Every game has some bad, so does this one, of course. But I believe the good far outweighs the bad you stumble upon.\n----------------------------------------\nLet's focus on the good, or should I say, the amazing.\n\nThe game is graphically and artistically beautiful. Every corner of the City has something going on or a story to tell and it's easy to get lost in the size of it all. You can mostly tell which part of the City you're in based on the surrounding mood or the language you're hearing.\n\nThere's an [b]abundance[/b] of side quests, gigs and general interactions waiting to be found, each with their own little fun. You get the story behind each gig and can fulfill certain conditions (like going full stealth) to increase your reward. Side quests are well-written as well and usually don't fall into the \"go here, fetch this, bring back\" category.\n\nThe [b]combat[/b] (which you're required to do in most of the gigs lol) is quite satisfying and you're given a lot of options for your build, each limited only by your creativity (or willingness to grind an attribute/skill out); you can do whatever you'd like and have fun with it.\n\nThe [b]people[/b] (characters) you meet in Night City feel like real people, with real emotions and real problems. You can relate to their issues and understand why they'd do something stupid, as well as learn their backstories and become... intimate with some of them, if you know what I mean.\n\n[b]Photo mode[/b] (despite it not listening to me later into my playthrough) is fleshed out and lets you do some really cool shots. It's even better with the recent-ish addition of the wardrobe, letting you actually look mega cool and not like you just put on whatever you could find in an alley. Spent way too much time posing in there, thank God time freezes when you do it, otherwise I'd have been arrested for public nuisance.\n\n[b]Ending[/b]: In the final mission, you're given a choice between a few paths you can take to fulfill your goal. I like the fact that these depend on the connections you've made throughout the game; wouldn't make a lot of sense for someone to help you if you haven't gone through the thick and thin with them.\n----------------------------------------\nHere's some of the aforementioned bad!\n\n[b]Bugs.[/b] The game is in a much better state now than it was when it first released (that was absolutely abysmal), but I still found myself stumbling upon bugs almost 3 years after the game's release. I found a car that was seemingly part of the building, whenever I'd use Power weapons it was almost guaranteed the ricochet thing would bug out and stay visible outside of combat (which was super annoying and would not go away without restarting the game), photo mode refused to work at a later point (the pictures would save corrupted) and I crashed a few times during my final achievement hunt. I used like 2 mods so it couldn't have been from that either. Overall, it's not AS bad as before, but be prepared for stuff going wack every once in a while.\n\nThe god-damn [b]skill tree[/b] is not as good as it could be. Skills usually come down to \"do x% more damage with x\", \"your cooldown for x is reduced\" etc. I'm sure a mod out there fixes this, but it's pretty lacking considering the caliber of the rest of the game.\n----------------------------------------\nIn conclusion:\n\n[b]Pick the game up[/b]. Especially if you can run it at a good frame rate, and super especially on sale. It's immersive, super moddable (even though I haven't tried that part), mega fun and overall an unforgettable experience.\n\nReview might get an edit after the DLC comes out, which will supposedly rework a large portion of base game.",

                "review": "Like the greats in the cyberpunk genre, “Cyberpunk 2077” asks what it means to be human and ponders the effects of a society run by mega corporations that have far too much control. However, the biggest failure of “Cyberpunk” is never taking these ideas far enough, making them feel shallow in a superficial setting that asks interesting questions, but fails to answer them thoughtfully.\n\nNight City is equal parts ugly and impressive. Dimly-lit bars brim with life, though an uncomfortably loud, orgasmic moan — originating from a television ad nearby — may interrupt your experience.\n\nAt its best, cyberpunk fiction can be a lens through which we examine our own world; A dystopian society is meant to be ugly. “‘Cyberpunk’ is a warning, not an aspiration,” said Mike Pondsmith, the creator of the tabletop game of which the video game is based from, in an interview with NME Magazine. But Night City doesn’t feel like a warning or an aspiration. Its fairly apolitical nature does little to encourage players to reflect on real-world problems upon completing the game.\n\nJohnny Silverhand, played by Keanu Reeves, has a significant role in the story as a co-protagonist. He plays the part well, giving the flawed character a believable redemptive arc.\n\nFor the past few years, CD Projekt Red has undergone damage control. The studio released a long series of patches, worked on improved compatibility across systems, and re-adjusted its DLC plans to focus more on quantity than quality.\n\nGamers looking for a cyber-filled RPG experience may wonder if Cyberpunk 2077 is worth playing today. The timing couldn’t be better. Lots and lots of patches later, Cyberpunk 2077 has broadly recovered from the technical problems it had at launch. If you quit Cyberpunk 2077 because of constant crashes or environments zipping in and out of existence, you can safely return to a much better experience. That alone is a reason to jump into Cyberpunk if you gave it a pass the first time.\n\nIn addition to smoother performance, Projekt Red has another bonus for those with high-end rigs and an interest in pushing graphics. There’s now a ray-tracing Overdrive mode adding graphics boosts for the latest Nvidia GPUs. There are a few improvements for other graphics cards too – things like ray-tracing when taking in-game photos. These benefits are noticeable for both players with less-expensive hardware and those with top gaming computers. It shows just how far Cyberpunk 2077 has come since its release.\n\n[b]THE GOOD[/b]\n- Addictive Storyline\n- Remarkable graphics and sound design\n- Memorable cast\n- Some excellent quests\n- Outstanding soundtrack\n\n[b]THE BAD[/b]\n- Terrible Bounty System\n\n[h1]9/10[/h1]\nDISASTER | BAD | MEDIOCRE | OKAY | GOOD | GREAT | [b][u]AMAZING[/u][/b] | MASTERPIECE\n[quote]\nIf you like this review, then please consider giving it a thumbs up.

                "review": "I started this game back in 2020 but because of the poor launch and my PC of that time couldn't handle the game in 21:9. I decided to wait for patches and for better PC and while I waited for few years I read and listened how everything is wrong with this game, how patches cant save this because it's whole core gameplay needs to be changed to fix it. Might be a matter of personal taste or the wrong image people had about this game (bad overhyped marketing) but only things I think needed actual change were police system, driving and the botched lifepaths.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2904458517\n\nRPGish gunplay is always kinda hard to nail down when you are just shooting mostly humans, it's nothing to boast about but it serves it purpose with fun and unique guns to play with. Quickhacking is like throwing spells mid combat/sneaking which makes things bit more interesting. Meat of the game is the stories it tells through main story and side jobs, which are good and made me care about people and get invested into their stories. pulling my heartstrings a bit with certain scenes.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2904462849\n\nOverall the wait was worth it for this journey, it offers some memorable moments and characters that will stick with me and when that ending credits scene hits with that music it got that rush of emotions out of me thinking about everything I've just experienced and accomplished. Still CDPR botched the launch and fucked this up for so many and wasting their trust they had built with Witchers, its hard to justify positive reviews for this game to some but for me personally this is now a good game after the patches and with the expansion coming out next year I'm actually excited to return to Night City but I will not buy the expansion until I've seen some trustworthy reviews. 8/10 never fade away. CDPR build your trust back to what it was and prove yourselves once again.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2904463480",

Buckle up for a grand ride with your choom Keanu, who justly loves his breathtaking self so much that his arm wore out and had to be swapped with a robotic one. All the while Takemura teaches the virtue of patience, awaiting you to finish making BD-worthy memories for 100+ hours. \n\nPlaying after patch 1.6, I avoided technical drama. The fixes are a big plus, at some cost to story immersion by CDPR putting less fuel on your real life hate for (mega)corporations. \n\nCombat/gameplay is well enough and allows catering to your style. Albeit with a multilayered leveling system that isn't intuitive in giving a good overview of options (you can't max everything). \n\nNo, it's not the hyped up \"second life simulator\". Many dialogue choices have limited to no effect. There aren't \"random\" (scripted) events or activities on every corner. But a preem gift with less fancy wrapping is still a preem gift - worth the €$.",

                "review": "TL DR; Imperfect, yet still one of the most enjoyable games I've ever played. To get the most out of this game, focus on the side quests.\n\nI feel like Cyberpunk has finally grown into the hype it built before it's launch. This is an insanely ambitious game. They aimed for the moon, and although they missed, they still landed somewhere in the stars.\n\nIn it's current state, although the trajectory of the game is quite linear and leaves a bit to be desired in terms of replayability, the story is well-written and the world is immersive and looks fantastic. \n\nWhen the game first launched I played as Nomad and lost interest very quickly. The opening was too slow for my liking, and full of bugs. \n\nRecently, after watching and enjoying the anime and hearing about the improvements, I gave it another go and was not disappointed.\n\nStarting as a Merc, you hit the ground running and the relationships built in the prologue feel very natural.\n\nI feel like the anime was the tutorial and lore-building for the game we didn't have, teaching how things work in Night City, the many builds and options available to us in the cyberpunk world like specific body modifications, the coolness of the sandevistan, etc. Which are all required knowledge to be a Merc.\n\nI think the game would have benefited from having more main story-line options, such as the one in the anime. Cyberpsychosis and some interesting shard lore is skimmed over in the game. A small number of decisions have a disproportionate impact while most have no impact.\n\nJackie was the only character in the game I felt a real sense of attachment to (until my 2nd play-through when I finished the Panam quest line -- which IMO should be part of the main story). The other main story characters are kind of thrust into your lap and you are expected to either like them or not. \"Crew\" building would be such a natural and great part of this game.\n\nAll that said, it's a real trip",

Johnny’s confrontational relationship with V and the eventual growth between them is the anchor of this story as they fight to find a solution to the shared mess they find themselves in. Cyberpunk 2077 setting is a hyper capitalist future in which megacorporations long ago exceeded the governments' ability to contain them. Nothing is off the table; everything is commodifiable.\n\n--{Graphics}---\n☑ You forget what reality is\n☐ Beautiful\n☐ Good\n☐ Decent\n☐ Bad\n☐ Don‘t look too long at it\n☐ Paint.exe\n\nDowntown Night City is soaked in 80s retrofuturism of neon and polyester. By contrast, the world of the rich and of megacorps is cold, shiny, and minimalist. The attention to detail is jaw dropping. One highlight is a corporate parade, when V makes their way through chattering crowds while holographic dragons float through the air between high-rise apartment complexes. Cyberpunk 2077 is the best-looking game released to date.  \n\n---{Gameplay}--- \n☑ Very good\n☐ Good\n☐ It‘s just gameplay\n☐ Mehh\n☐ Starring at walls is better\n☐ Just don‘t\n\nYou invest points into five primary attributes, and then into perks within each of those for more specialized improvements. What’s great about this system is that these attributes and perks generally felt like they were only enhancing whatever playstyle I wanted to lean into.

CD Projekt Red spent a good 18 months or so improving and adding to Cyberpunk 2077, fixing all the issues that were present at launch.\n\n---{Ultrawide Support}---\n☑ Full support\n☐ Can play in 21:9 but needs some tweaking\n☐ No support at all\n\n---{9/10}---\nCyberpunk 2077 was eagerly anticipated in 2020, once released gamers felt incredibly let down as the game was clearly not finished. After numerous patches the game feels like it's more of a completed product, but the damage has already been done to CD Projekt Red's reputation. While it still falls short when measured against the immense expectations that surrounded its release, Cyberpunk 2077 still hits most of its initial targets. The main story's a thrill ride, the combat is fantastic, and Night City is an incredible open world setting.\n",

                "review": "I was not seated in the glorious hype-train the CDPR had put on the rails. Instead, I chose to wait until it improved before giving it a try, to avoid disappointment from bugs and complaints. At the beginning of 2023, I started playing the game with low expectations and to my surprise, I freakin’ loved it.\n\n[h1]Never Fade Away[/h1]\n\nI think the theme and world-building of the game are its strongest points. The game does an excellent job of presenting Night City as a city full of disasters, where even the smallest mistake could end with your dead body in a landfill and nobody gives a fuck. \n\nThe various affiliations, such as the evil corporations that control the world with technology, healthcare, and even military services, the street kids and their gangs like Valentinos with their Chicano culture, The Voodoo Boys with their technological version of Haitian Voodoo, or 6th Street who wants to see NUSA great again, Nomads like Aldaceldos who reject the shiny walls, scrappers and the “dreams” that the city has to offer, instead cling to their “family” values.\n\nThe game convincingly showcases the consequences of these affiliations in every aspect of the world, whether it be economic, political, or spiritual. It's clear that the developers did their homework on the Cyberpunk universe and brought it to life in a remarkable way, much like the Witcher series.\n\n[h1]A Like Supreme[/h1]\n\nI somehow managed to avoid major spoilers for a year and I was very pleased with the main story. [spoiler] V and Johnny's struggle with their identities, a blend of Fight Club and Matrix, is in a fine line between multiple personality disorder, schizophrenia, and depersonalization. It is fascinating to see V die and be reborn as a new person - both literally and figuratively -  to the realities of Night City and work through their issues with Johnny, who is a completely different persona, a legend of the past. [/spoiler]\n\nThe balance between side jobs, world events, and main jobs aren’t as smooth as I expected it to be. Despite playing the game without taking a long break I had trouble with connecting with some of the characters, or understanding their motivations for certain actions. It is most likely designed around the main story and “main” side jobs which are included in endings.\n\nThree specific side jobs stood out to me and showed the game's potential.\n[spoiler] The Sinnerman questline with Stephenson, a former criminal who turns to religion and is exploited by the Evil Corp for a crucifixion instead of a death sentence, is an incredibly engaging and provided emotional tension throughout the quest. The second is River's questline about an ordinary NYPD officer whose nephew is kidnapped by a man who brainwashes lost teenagers into becoming Cyberpunk versions of what you would call a human-brood-stock. Lastly, there's Peralez's questline about an honest politician who is unknowingly controlled by corporations due to injected false memories and how they become paranoid and lose everything over time. [/spoiler]\n\nThese three side quests share one big commonality: they're grounded in reality and have a relatable approach, even though the technology and the instruments of the era are different. \n\nOverall I like the main story, and I feel like they did not use all the potential they had in many aspects of the game. The majority of the side jobs feel uninspired, but there are hints of what could have been better. I'm hopeful for improvement with the upcoming DLCs and sequel.\n\n[h1]Chippin In’[/h1]\n\nThe gameplay is intriguing with the possibility to test out different builds and optimize your cyberwave to handle everything the City throws at you.\nFor example you can use Sandavista [i]- like Martinez in the anime -[/i] and turn into a glorious katana-wielding Solo merc, be a knife-throwing or pistoleer assassin that prefers quiet, stealthy approach [i]- like a thief as Takemura calls it -[/i]  or you can go full Netrunner, basically Cyberpunk variant of mage, and perish everyone by just hacking them over their own security cameras. \n\nUnfortunately, it gets stale & repetitive quickly and you realize that the “many builds out there to discover” is a mere illusion even though it can be enhanced to some point by mods. Just like the plot, I see a great potential in the combat and build systems but it is definitely not implemented in a “complete” way.\n\nSide activities such as NYPD Announcements and Gigs turn into mindless repetitive activities after a short time, despite my efforts uncover their story through the messages and objectives given by the Fixers. They just turned into various chores to get 100% completion.\n\nIt's been over a year since its release but there are still persistent bugs that sometimes require loading a previous quick save.  The bugs didn’t ruin my gameplay, but it forces the player to take frequent quick saves to prevent any gameplay errors.\n\nThe general consensus that the game being “unfinished” is mostly applies to the gameplay, and I agree on that. It is enjoyable, but definitely not polished enough.\n\n[h1]Archangel[/h1]\n\nIn conclusion, Cyberpunk 2077 is a game that has the potential to be a classic in the gaming world, but it falls short due to its incomplete gameplay, repetitive side activities, lingering bugs and its take on the side stories. Despite these issues the game is still enjoyable and worth playing, especially for those who are fans of open-world games or interested in the futuristic theme. \n\nYet again, I believe that the gameplay in the Witcher series was not outstanding either but it was the unique theme, setting, and compelling stories that turned it into a legendary piece. I hope to see a similar emphasis on storytelling in Cyberpunk, which would make it even more captivating.\n\nThe narrative, character development and world-building are highlights of the game, and it was a fun journey that I spent hours and hours on. I definitely recommend it.\n\n",

I have to say, the graphics in this game are absolutely breathtaking. As one of the first games to fully support RTX technology, the level of detail and realism in the game's environments and characters is truly impressive.\n\nFrom the neon-lit streets of Night City to the intricate cybernetic augmentations on characters' bodies, every aspect of the game's visual design is top-notch. The level of attention to detail is truly remarkable, and it's clear that the developers put a lot of time and effort into making the game look as immersive and believable as possible.\n\nOne of the things that really stood out to me in the game was the character customization. Players have a lot of control over how their character looks, from their hairstyle and clothing to the cybernetic enhancements they can equip. This level of customization really made me feel like my character was unique and personal to me.\n\nThe gameplay itself is also incredibly engaging. The game's open-world design allows players to explore Night City and take on a variety of missions and side quests. The combat system is fast-paced and satisfying, with a variety of weapons and abilities to choose from. The story is also well-written and engaging, with plenty of twists and turns to keep players on their toes.\n\nOverall, I would say that Cyberpunk 2077 is a truly impressive game. The graphics are some of the best I've ever seen in a video game, and the gameplay and story are both incredibly well-done. I would highly recommend this game to anyone looking for an immersive and engaging open-world experience.",

HOWEVER a few small bugs like flying cigars or an eventual flying weapon glitch might be seen during your playthrough.\n\nBy now you probably know that in this game you play as V, a mercenary in Night City who gets caught up in a conspiracy that could change the city forever a very old pertaining philosophical question of when life begins - but with a twist! Now the more contemporaneous question would be: if another person's conscience was being uploaded in your brain, when would your life end and their life begin again?\n\nThe characters you meet along the way are mostly unique and interesting, and the voice acting is top-notch. E.g: Keanu Reeves plays Johnny Silverhand and - let me tell you - he absolutely kills it.\n\nCyberpunk 2077 customization options are numerous, allowing you to create a character that looks like they've been through the wringer and come out the other side stronger than ever. And let's be real, who likes cyberpunk and doesn't want to give themselves some cybernetic enhancements and become a total badass?\n And if you're really into the cyberpunk vibe, you need to check out Cyberpunk: Edgerunners. It's an anime set in the same world as the game and makes the whole experience even richer!\n\nThe gameplay is just as wild as the world it's set in. You'll be shooting, hacking, and sneaking your way through Night City, taking down anyone who stands in your way. \n\nWith that said even with all the technical corrections Cyberpunk 2077 still carries the scars of a game that was rushed: most vendors in the streets are not interactive and just exist for showing but the player is unable to even speak to them, which makes some streets feel a bit depthless/one-dimensional. There is also a very silly flaw: you are in a futuristic city where people can change almost anything in their bodies however there is not option of listening to radio songs while you're walking/ running around! It's like no one ever invented even a simple walkman!\nWith all that said, fortunately there are mods to fix those flaws (check out nexus mods for more).\n\nSo if you're looking for a game that will transport you to a neon-soaked dystopian future, where you can hack, shoot, and enhance your way into becoming an overpowered Behemoth, then Cyberpunk 2077 is the game for you. \nJust buckle up and enjoy the ride!",

You start to feel depressed when you realise a situation and atmosphere of this city and world in general. Endless wars of corporations , crime over the top and alot of psychos without any moral values. That was part about plot. Now about game mechanic in general . Visual part is great but optimisation sucks sometimes . All characters feels alive , their habits and movement . This game really held my attention. I wish i could erase my memory to finish the game one more time",

Wish I had done it years ago, even with all the bugs the game had along with its rough start.\n\nI decided to give it a chance and it did not disappoint. In fact it turned out to be exactly my kind of game, combining RPG elements and stuff inspired from some of my favorite movies (including, but not limited to Lawnmower Man and Blade Runner) with Deus Ex (especially the sometimes-annoying hacking minigame) and GTA-like gameplay.\n\nI guess when I first gave it a shot years ago, I wasn't in the mood for that specific type of games - the progress tree can be a little bit distracting and intimidating at first, if you're confused and not sure what to do and how to start off your character.\n\nActually, one of the things that threw me off that time was me failing to use stealth. I am not sure if they revised the tutorial-like beginning mission later on but I am one for using stealth in games a lot, and, for whatever reason, that did not work back then. That is one thing that made me think this game was not for me. Not this time, however, and I went the max Intelligence path and never looked back...\n\nWith one small insignificant exception, I can say there are no more graphical glitches in the game. That small exception can sometimes be seen when a character might pass through a car or something, or in some specific missions you have to move the body in front of a locked door, in order for the door to work.\n\nGraphics wise, this game looks very, very pretty... but it is a monster and for the first time in my life, I had to resort to DLSS - but I'm not sorry I did so. Running on a RTX 3080, ray tracing ran pretty well too, most of the time, but because of my older system, bottlenecks in certain areas made me turn it off for most of the game. Not really felt that much of a difference, in fact it felt less distracting, so no regrets here either.\n\nIf you're a fan of Deus Ex: Human Revolution, give this one a fair chance. You might be pleasantly surprized.",

I dont know how, or why I got so invested in this game but I did and immediately want to start all over. This time as opposing sex V, and also because I realized I missed a few secret gigs from choices (ala Jackie's mom etc.}  Did the same with Phantom Liberty and that was equally if not more fun than the main game. \n\nI appreciate the hard work to bring this game back from the state I played on Series X close to 2 years ago. There was a time after that I didnt want to touch this game again, but all the kudos to CDPR for changing not only my experience but anyone else who loves this game as much as I now do and I now will try to be patient for the sequel",

From the moment you step into the game, you're transported into a world that is equal parts beautiful and terrifying at the same time its kinda reminded me of blade-runner 2049 of how the world is kinda f♥uckd up in the future\n\nOne of the standout features of Cyberpunk 2077 is its attention to detail. From the intricate character designs to the sprawling cityscapes, everything in this game feels meticulously crafted and thought out. The level of immersion is truly unparalleled, and it's easy to get lost in the world for hours on end.\n\nBut it's not just the visuals that make Cyberpunk 2077 such a great game. The story is engaging and well-written, with plenty of twists and turns to keep you on the edge of your seat. The voice acting is also top-notch, with a talented cast bringing the characters to life in a way that feels authentic and believable.\n\nThe gameplay is also incredibly fun, with a variety of combat options and character customization that make each playthrough feel unique. Whether you prefer to go in guns blazing or take a stealthier approach, there are plenty of ways to tackle each mission.\n\nFinally, I'm a little disappointed about Adam Smasher strengths but i guess this is how the story told Cyberpunk 2077 is an incredible game that is definitely worth your time. With its stunning visuals, engaging story, and fun gameplay, it's a must-play for any fan of open-world games or science fiction.",

                "review": "I don't understand the hate this game gets. It is pretty good, the story isn't repetitive. On the other hand, it's pretty cool with more endings. Yea, sure, the Life Path doesn't change much but it's still a pretty cool idea. Overall, I really enjoyed this game. The driving is a little bit arcade-like but that's fine. After all the patches, it turned out pretty good and I think it deserves a chance. Lot of fun for 30 Euros in sale. I really liked some of the characters and the way they developed throughout the game. The love-hate relationship with Johnny, where he is the coolest guy ever at one moment and then a complete A-hole in the other. The songs were pretty cool as well, lot of genres. And one thing that I totally love in this game are the side missions. Like you have a self-aware gun at one point, guy that sees himself as the Messiah or Monks that still choose pacifism, even if it means one of their brothers get killed. There is just so much to the game than it seems. Lot of different cars, weapons and outfits to unlock as well. SO MANY individual fighting and play styles that replaying the game makes it something totally different with new builds. I know that it's not what lot of people expected, after all those years of waiting. But people like me, who haven't waited for the game's release that long, weren't really associated with it before the trailer with Keanu Reeves/it's release or the anime Edgerunners, this kind of people won't feel that wronged. As I already said, this game deserves a chance. The vibe of it is something no other cyberpunk game offers.\nAnd if you have watched the anime, it's something completely unique. I really want to stay at your house. IYKYK\n\nTo summarize this, it's a fun game with a great deal of stuff to do and places to explore.\nIt isn't something world breaking but still a good game after being patched.\nSome bugs may occur but they aren't frequent anymorem they are a rarity just how it's supposed to be. The grame has crashed only once, with lot of mods installed.\nCharacters and story isn't on the level of RDR or TLOU, but it's still appreciable. \nIn the end, it's a 9,1/10. Little flaws and sort of repetitive contracts, but ultimately a satisfactory experience.",

                "review": "A lot has already been said about the state of Cyberpunk 2077, especially right after launch. Now, with some time and patches, have things improved and can Cyberpunk 2077 redeem itself?\nWell, i guess that heavily depends - There's a lot of light, but also, still, a bit of shadow.\n\nIn Cyberpunk 2077, you're playing as the character \"V\", a Mercenary trying to become famous in Night City. You can fully customize your character and you got quite an extensive choice of doing so.\nAfter a heist going wrong, you must find a way to fix the damage that has been done, with a new ally at your side.\n\nFinding the solution to the problem you caused will lead you through Night City, doing several main and side-quests for a multitude of characters.\nThis is usually where Cyberpunk 2077 shines. The voice-acting of the characters is fantastic and each one has it's own unique personality.\nThe quality of the main- and side-quest is also mostly very good. There are obviously some that are more memorable than others, but a lot of them are quite intriguing with some being really fantastic.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2329649239\n\nVisually, the game is great as well. Night City itself, with it's neon lights, advertisements everywhere and huge mega-blocks is a fantastic looking city, with the outskirts being a dry desert-like environment with huge trash dumps throughout. \nImmersion-wise it's a hit and miss. There's actually little to interact with or do in Night City, besides following quests or doing the smaller Gigs (which are mostly just little flavour missions to earn money and level up).\nNow, there are some easter-eggs to be found throughout the world, but they're very few and far in between - one for example was a reference to the infamous Indiana Jones fridge-scene, where Indy was hiding from, and surviving, a nuclear blast. It did get a chuckle out of me, but it's mostly just not that interesting to really explore things, as you mostly just find items or crafting components which you'll get plenty through missions themselves. There is detail in the streets, on the walls with graffiti, art etc. but it's all surface level.\nA lot of that is standard nowadays with open world titles, but i just feel it's a missed opportunity to bring in more things to do, interact with and give the player a deeper dive into the City and world of Cyberpunk.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2918074060\n\nFrom a technical perspective, i had little issues. No crashes, no huge bugs or anything. However, there are still glitches and bugs that pull you out of your immersion. It's not necessarily too bad, but it can be annoying, especially if it's in (cut)scenes that want to convey a more serious tone or a heartwarming moment. This ranged from characters grabbing a bottle and having a drinking animation, while not actually having anything in their hands, a character running around with a gun in it's hand in a crucial and serious in tone endsequence. Sometimes traffic behaves erratic without my involvement, hearing sound close by that sounds like a fight or car crash while not seeing anything.\nI also encountered pop-ins every once in a while and the view distance could also be quite low-quality sometimes.\nOverall, those all were smaller issues, but not as rare as i would have hoped.\n\nGameplay wise there's a lot of variety, from being a stealthy quick-hacking expert or jumping into the fight head-on with a wide variety of guns or getting some implants for your arms to either slash up your enemies, punch them or hit them with the mono-wire. It's fun to try out things and play differently each time, though you can't re-specc completely (only perks, not your main attributes), which is a shame imho and a choice i also don't really understand.\n\nNowadays, you can also wear whatever items give you the best stats AND not look like an absolute clown, as they've added the option to make you appear in any outfit that you've found, regardless of what you are actually wearing.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2320602055\n\nThe fixes and additions are, all in all, in my opinion relatively minor in scope, but they do improve the game, especially the smaller quality of life improvements. Is it a totally different game or experience now, than it was before?\nEh, not really, unless you were absolutely plagued by bugs and technical issues.\n\nBut overall, and coming to my personal conclusion, it is a good game. Put aside the disappointment from what it could have been, it's a good experience, with memorable characters and quests in a visually impressive world, that's unfortunately a bit shallow.\nThe cyberpunk themes, world and lore is interesting and the gameplay is quite fun.\nWhile it's still janky at times and has things that could be improved (seriously, why is the view of the mini-map so limited and small???) it's a good game in my opinion.\nUnfortunately, i think this game tarnished it's own brand and that of CDProjekt Red quite heavily. Not sure if they're planning a sequel/prequel/another entry but i doubt it, which is a shame, cause if it wouldn't have been such a technical disaster at launch, this could have been quite a hit.\nNow, it's legacy might just be being a good game with a lot of disappointment attached to it.",

Chop 1 large onion into small dice, about 5mm square. The easiest way to do this is to cut the onion in half from root to tip, peel it and slice each half into thick matchsticks lengthways, not quite cutting all the way to the root end so they are still held together. Slice across the matchsticks into neat dice.\n\nSTEP 2\nCut 1 red pepper in half lengthways, remove stalk and wash the seeds away, then chop. Peel and finely chop 2 garlic cloves.\n\nSTEP 3\nStart cooking. Put your pan on the hob over a medium heat. Add 1 tbsp oil and leave it for 1-2 minutes until hot (a little longer for an electric hob).\n\nSTEP 4\nAdd the onion and cook, stirring fairly frequently, for about 5 minutes, or until the onion is soft, squidgy and slightly translucent.\n[21:03]\nSTEP 5\nTip in the garlic, red pepper, 1 heaped tsp hot chilli powder or 1 level tbsp mild chilli powder, 1 tsp paprika and 1 tsp ground cumin.\n\nSTEP 6\nGive it a good stir, then leave it to cook for another 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.\n\nSTEP 7\nBrown 500g lean minced beef. Turn the heat up a bit, add the meat to the pan and break it up with your spoon or spatula. The mix should sizzle a bit when you add the mince.\n\nSTEP 8\nKeep stirring and prodding for at least 5 minutes, until all the mince is in uniform, mince-sized lumps and there are no more pink bits. Make sure you keep the heat hot enough for the meat to fry and become brown, rather than just stew.\n\nSTEP 9\nMake the sauce. Crumble 1 beef stock cube into 300ml hot water.

I came up on a bug like the motorcyle stopping and not moving and when i try to exit, it disappears. Besides this bug, vehicle dynamics are funny. NPC dialogues are bland. \n\nThe story, acting, combat makes up for it. Its very immersive and screenshots, videos do not do justice to this game. After all this is what I was after, I do feel like I am walking around in 2077. Thats enough for me.",

My PC - which isn't state of the art - didn't really have any issues playing it at the time, so I'll count myself lucky on that front. \n\nThe game that I played on launch was perfectly fine, but it did feel a bit dated. Gameplay wise it felt like an open world Deus Ex game. If this came out shortly after Mankind Divided it would've been much more impressive than when it did.\n\nNow, 3 years later, the 2.0 update has come out. And it not only improves on many gameplay aspects of the game, such as police chases. But it also miraculously improved the performance for many. The game was already \"playable\" on SteamDeck, but the 2.0 update makes it one of the best modern games on the Deck.",

It's a title that carries immense potential and genuinely impressive moments, making it worth a positive critique despite its hiccups.\n\nThe metropolis of Night City stands as a visual marvel, a neon-soaked dreamscape that begs to be explored. Its skyscrapers, bustling streets, and gritty atmosphere create an immersive cyberpunk world that draws you in with its sheer scale and attention to detail. The story that unfolds within this vivid backdrop is intricate and multi-layered, delivering a tale of intrigue, morality, and political maneuvering that keeps you engaged from start to finish.\n\nAdmittedly, Cyberpunk 2077's launch was marred by technical issues, especially on older consoles. Performance problems, crashes, and graphical glitches were disappointing, but it's heartening to witness CD Projekt Red's ongoing commitment to rectify these issues. With each patch, the game has improved, and it's now in a much better state than at its launch.\n\nWhat truly shines in Cyberpunk 2077 is the storytelling and character development. The main narrative and the multitude of side quests offer choices that genuinely matter, leading to impactful consequences. These choices add depth to the game's world and characters, making every decision feel significant.\n\nThe combat and gameplay mechanics provide a range of customization options, allowing you to craft your own playstyle. The hacking and cyberware systems add layers of strategy to battles, and while there's room for improvement, the overall combat experience is engaging.\n\nIn summary, Cyberpunk 2077 is a game that, despite its rocky start, has evolved into a compelling and immersive cyberpunk experience. Its stunning visuals, intricate storytelling, and character depth outweigh the early technical shortcomings. With ongoing improvements, it continues to shape into the masterpiece it was envisioned to be, offering players a captivating journey through the neon-soaked streets of Night City. For fans of the genre, it's a title that delivers a thrilling dive into a futuristic world full of potential and intrigue.",

I always fired it up as patches dropped and messed with it for a bit then dropped out till next patch. With that said, this new 2.0 patch is amazing. Sure there are always more they could tweak and fix but so far; this patch fixed a good amount of all the issues and issues I was having. \n\nI have a toaster of a computer, but could play this game pretty well and still looks good enough. When this patch came out I was a bit hesitant to download and install it being I was afraid it might demand more form my computer that it has to offer. But to my pleasant surprise, I think it runs and looks way better and the FPS I get now even if low are more smooth and unnoticeable . So now it doesn't take away from my experience with the game and can still enjoy it. I don't get any more laggy chops or stutterers like I did before when Driving and in Gun Battles. \n\nWhen all were Trashing the game, I kept saying to them \" Give them Time! As long as they are working on patches or updates, things will get fixed and over time drivers will get better as well to improve our gaming experience.\" I always said also \"That I have full faith in CD Projekt Red fixing and making things right for their customers, it will just take time\".\n\nSo, Kudos to you guys and when I can I'll toss a coin ( A little WItcher humor :P ) to you guys, and pick up Phantom Liberty soon! I give this game now a rating of  9 out of 10 stars! So if you love FPS RPG, Openworld with a good story and an amazing world to get lost in, I say Jack this one into your cart ASAP! Game is a masterpiece! Enjoy!",

You're literally spoilt for choice. The world looks amazing and feels super immersive, I loved wandering the streets of Night City and taking snaps. There's so much to see and do and you become absorbed; I was truly invested in the characters and found it difficult to make tough choices, knowing there'd be various implications. A* of a game.

                "review": "Let me know if you can relate...\n\nPrior to 2.0\n\nA couple years ago I bought this. From the very beginning,  it never felt right.  It never looked quite right. I will say honestly that it was physically uncomfortable to play, because the entire time I just wanted to be playing something entirely different.  It was like being on a bad date with someone you SHOULD like and SHOULD be into, but instead they are irritating to even look at let alone be around, and you find yourself wondering what your ex is up to ( Pretty sure I reinstalled Arkham City or Arkham Origins, to cleanse my pallette).  \n\nBTW: I never experienced ANY technical issues back then--it ran surprisingly well at 1080p on my gtx1070 and ryzen 7 1700x).\n\nAnyways, I was IMMEDIATELY wanting mods to fix it back then, to make it FEEL right (gunplay, gameplay, leveling, you name it) and less of a bad date experience.  Tried mods, like some might try cocaine or alcohol to make a date more tolerable, but NOPE.  It still never felt right and good to be in game...and it became the worst thing a game could be: BORING.   The gameplay and gunplay wasn't just meh. It was super-meh. The graphics, though they ran fine, never looked right: to continue the bad/weird date metaphor, time in-game was like slowly noticing how the \"hot girl\" sitting across from me actually has hands a little too big, shoulders a little too wide, almost has an Adam's apple....aaaand yeah I'm off to that long \"bathroom break\" known as uninstallation.  \n\nFast forward to to a couple weeks ago....\n\nLike everyone else, I'm seeing a lot of headlines about the DLC.  People are hyping it up.  I'm reserving some interest, but expecting reality to be another bait-and-switch where.....(insert punchline I don't want to get canceled for).\n\nBut then heard the 2.0 update was a major overhaul of....EVERYTHING.  And I heard that it was legit. And that it changed the entire game; Graphics, leveling system, combat, you name it.  At this point it started to look like CDPR was determined to carry out their own \"No Man's Sky redemption arc\" ( a game I've never played, btw, but a story I've followed closely).\n\nI reinstalled (actually had to re-reinstall a couple times to undo modding from previous installations) and fired it up.\n\nSince then, and I haven't gotten too far into it, it's like an entirely different game, and completely redeems all of my previous criticisms.\n\n--Mods: no need.  I haven't even thought about getting mods yet (whereas previously I was itching for mods within the first few minutes).  I never once considered doing a full Vanilla playthrough on the previous versions.\n\n1. Graphics 9/10  I have no idea what they did to the graphics, but they are GOOD, and it's noticeable.  No, I don't know or care why -- they just look right, and feel right.  Performance seems improved as well.  It's basically what they promised and what they showed prior to original release.  Add to this the INCREDIBLE level design and attention to detail....seriously what even compares right now? \n\n2. Gameplay ??? I can't give a number yet because I haven't done enough...but it's looking 8-9ish easily, so far.\n-Even the driving feels waaaaay better. Especially on motorcycles.   \n-Gunplay: gunplay is waaaay better: I haven't played Destiny since the original, years ago--but  the action and sense of impact with the firearms reminds me of how noticeably good the gunplay was in Destiny.  \n-Inventory:  so far inventory isn't an issue, and I haven't gotten annoyed by it at all (previously I was annoyed within the first hour)\n\n3. World (Level design & \"IS this Cyberpunk2077?\" ) ???  Looking like 9/10 or 10/10 so far.  Previously I couldn't get past the other issues enough to even care. The whole thing felt lame. Now it really is like you're getting dropped into that world and lore they had talked about and hyped up before release.  The author/creator of the original Cyberpunk 2077 board game and IP had previously said these guys were doing it the right way and truly building out his world. Unfortunately the game they released was bleh.  I don't know how they did it but they fixed the game part, the graphics part, and now the WORLD part is shining through.  If I wind up not liking it, it's going to be because I don't like Cyberpunk 2077 itself, not because CDPR made a mess of the IP.  \n\n4. RPG (leveling and builds)  ??? all I know is that it feels like a real system this time, and one they actually thought through.  Can't give it a number yet but this time it seems like the devs have done their part and it's on the player to capitalize.  Previously, it was like they threw something together and hoped it would work out--hence instant desire for modders to make the game good.   \n\n5. Conclusion: if the earlier release pissed you off, reinstall for 2.0.  It's worth it.  It's good. If you've been waiting for CDPR or some modder to fix the game, the game is fixed.  Again, I experienced the previous version as expensive, tragic, grandiose trash.   It was hard to even think of it as an actual game when I played it.  Now it's what they said it would be.  \n\nWill come back to eat crow and update my review if my opinion changes much--but the reason I'm here writing it is because all the technical, design, and gameplay elements that made me hate it before, are.....well they surprised us and just made it all good.  I'm surprised.  Are you surprised??  comment below!",

                "review": "TLDR: Should have been this way at launch, took 3 years but this is good and update did alot.\n\n\nI pre-ordered Cyberpunk 2077 nearly a year in advance and have been playing on and off since its rocky launch. The game was fun despite some jank at release, with a good story and characters.\n\nWith the recent 2.0 update, CD Projekt Red has made some major improvements that really enhance the overall experience. As detailed in the extensive patch notes, the developers overhauled many core gameplay systems including the police, driving, combat, crafting, and more. Some highlights for me are the new vehicle customization and combat options while driving, expanded netrunning capabilities, revamped enemy AI behavior, and the complete overhaul of the perk system.\n\nIt's clear a lot of thought and effort went into improving the existing framework while preserving player progression. For example, we get perk points refunded in the new system so you don't lose all your progress. The game runs and looks noticeably smoother now on my PC (SSD, i7-7700K, 1080). \n\nNight City feels more alive with enhanced NPC and traffic behaviors. After spending more time with version 2.0, I can say this is the quality level Cyberpunk 2077 should have achieved at launch. \n\nIt took over 3 years but with this update it finally realizes more of its potential. Veteran players have a lot of new content and tweaks to dive into. \n\nIf you bounced off Cyberpunk 2077 before, now is a great time to give it another shot.",

                "review": "FIRST AND FOREMOST: If you plan on buying this game and trying it for the 2 hours to refund if it isn't your cup of coffee, the prologue alone took me 2-3 hours. Everything I will talk about will only be from those first hours. Will be a very minor spoiler at the end of this review.\n\nThis is more of a FIRST IMPRESSION rather than a fleshed out review for someone that, like me, was on the fence about getting this game after all these years but hearing about this 2.0 update sparked their interest. \nCyberpunk 2077 is a narrative RPG. Don't buy this expecting an open world sandbox like Starfield, per say (sorry to compare but it's the easiest way to get the idea across, that will be my only comparision).\n\nPROS: The world feels alive, extremely alive. There are events happening all around, crime scenes and crimes in motion (that you can often interact with, but not in some main character detective way). People walking the streets and actually interacting with each other (and they aren't all copy and pasted NPCs either, they all look different, they have varying heights, have different walking styles, and there are even children that actually look like children, not shrunken adults). This so far this is my favorite thing about this game, the reactive world.\nThe world building is amazing. The game naturally gives you the opportunity to learn about the lore of this world, whether through dialogue choices (that are usually optional), books (or this world's equivalent), or even quests that simply reveal more to you just through playing. \nThe voice acting / mo-cap are amazing. As this is a narrative RPG, you will spend much time in scripted \"sit down\" moments where you will talk with another character. Often times in games, NPCs just stand still and do a few idle animations in dialogue, but in Cyberpunk, they feel REAL. The talent behind the characters (including your own player character) is impressive and adds to the immersion and that \"alive world\" I mentioned earlier.\nThe story characters are extremely well written and ALSO feel very real and alive. The characters I have met so far have been amazing to interact with and 9 times out of 10, I always want to interact with them more. The VA and mo-cap I mentioned earlier help this, but I mean that the characters themselves are genuinely interesting. I have found myself wanting to learn more about certain characters at every chance. This is also true for the player character, who I actually enjoy playing with and enjoy progressing with.\nThe movement feels smooth and real as well. Running, walking, and climbing around the map feels great. Another thing, your character ACTUALLY moves at the same walking speed as NPCs during dialogue, as opposed to being too fast or too slow. I think we can all agree this is great.\nThe AI act smart and threatening in combat, actually using tactics to make your experience more difficult, such as flanking.\nThe graphics aren't groundbreaking but they are beautiful, and sometimes they do *almost* feel groundbreaking.\nALL in ALL, the immersion that Cyberpunk 2077 often brings is outstanding, with a few caveats listed further below.\nTHE IN BETWEEN: The combat is a little iffy, at least at low levels. I'm sure it will get better but for the purpose of those 2-3 hours, the combat feels very stiff. I don't mean that the movement is stiff, but rather the actual gun-play and melee combat. Melee combats felt like I was just trading blows with the enemy until they died, there is counters, but they seem less useful than just pummeling your enemy by using heavy attacks to break the guard. Melee weapons lacked impact very often, which broke immersion. Ranged combat was a little bit better but still feels \"off\" to me, perhaps cheap. Enemies kind of just get shot with little reaction, with the exception of a shotgun I used, which would level them off their feet. Once again, ranged weapons also suffer from impact. Stealth at low levels is also sort of meh. You will use gadgets at your disposal to influence the enemy (distractions, for example) and then sneak up behind them and neutralize them using a handful of the same default animations. It is worth noting, if you are a fan of non-lethal take-downs in games, much like myself, Cyberpunk does have them, which I thoroughly enjoy. It is also worth noting that enemies won't ALWAYS just die from gunshots or other more deadly force means, meaning you can shoot someone and neutralize them as a threat, but they will still be alive on the floor laying in pain. I thought this was amazing and it really adds to the immersion this game brings. NOW, the \"cyber combat\" I suppose you could call it, is where the fun really begins. Without spoiling too much, the augments you can receive in this game add much variation to the combat, both melee and ranged. An example of one such ability is the option to remotely detonate a gas tank, which can not only outright kill your enemies, but also disorient them and cause confusion. \nOnce again, this is a 2-3 FIRST IMPRESSION, it is very possible that the combat will get better as I progress my skills and unlock better weaponry.\nThe loot system is questionable. I am not sure how the game was before 2.0. but looting is repetitive and feels almost \"looter shooter\" like. Almost all enemies have one shared item that they will drop (some form of crafting item) and then some will drop their weapons and some will drop \"health items\". Sometimes the enemy would drop their weapon, but it would be broken and also just give the same generic grafting item. The problem is that I often found myself picking up all the enemies weapons just to sell them anyway, which isn't bad, but it also just feels like a waste of time at the end of the day. Because the player character starts off being able to carry well over 100 lbs, I would just stock up on loot to sell. The reason this isn't a con is because it isn't a big deal and can be remedied by simply not looting, but I'd rather have loot be more meaningful. Example: killing an enemy and being able to take their outfit if you so wanted to, rather than JUST a crafting component.\nTHE CONS: I have heard that Cyberpunk 2077 has come a long way since release and that most of the bugs have been ironed out, but remember, as a first time player, what I see now is what matters, and I have seen bugs. Nothing game breaking but enough to be an annoyance. An example of one such bug was all of my enemies floating about 1-2 feet off the ground during combat. It's not a BIG deal but it is noticeable and it is annoying. \nGraphical errors are abundant as well, and I don't mean that the game runs bad, I play almost max settings across the board with my 3080. I mean that there are many graphical artifacts and glitches that I noticed that I wouldn't expect to see this far into the games release. Some examples are missing textures, player models having invisible parts (I suppose this could go with missing textures), and glitched out structures in the distance. These also haven't been game breaking but they are noticeable and immersion breaking.\n\nMINOR SPOILER (no names included)\n\n[spoiler] The game has a phone mechanic (you can call and text other players you encounter throughout the story). After finishing a mission, a certain NPC perishes, and the player character is also wounded. In game, weeks pass while we are recovering. Upon waking up, I checked my phone to see if their contact was still there, and it was. I decided to the call them, and the call went through to voicemail. I was given the option to have dialogue with the deceased voicemail and express my condolences to the departed. [/spoiler]\n\nSuch a small detail goes a long way, and unless the quality drops, Cyberpunk 2077 gets a recommendation from me. Just remember, if you buy this expecting to refund, it took me over 2 hours to finish the prologue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

It is a masterpiece with the game's mechanics, world, gameplay, story, characters, graphics and color palette. It is both right and sad that it is remembered this way when it could be the best game in the history of the game. It was enjoyable for me most of the time.

                "review": "Engl: Three years after the game's release, I'm ready to review it. What the studio CD Projekt Red could never be reproached for is taking “Conscious risks,” and Cyberpunk 2077 was no exception to this rule. Today is September 22, 2023, and I am ready to say with a clear conscience: “The game has been released,” yes, I know that the game was released in December 2020, but what we have now in release 2.0 and the version dated December 2020 is heaven and earth. All the mechanics that didn’t work before, and only caused disgust and a desire to quit the game, were finally fixed in patch 2.0. Now the police are the police, and not costumed clowns who appeared out of nowhere. The main character now has arms and legs while climbing stairs. NPCs have learned to react adequately to shots (the combat system has become much more pleasant than it was before). The skill tree has been completely redesigned (you can change their combinations only once - please note).  In addition, interaction with minor characters has become much more enjoyable, now at least it feels like some kind of RPG roleplaying. In general, everything that should have been fixed was fixed. Thus, if you were put off by this game when it was released in 2020, you can safely pick it up - you won’t regret it. However, keep in mind that the system requirements, along with the detail and new features, have increased many times over.                                                           And in conclusion, it’s worth saying about what patch 2.0 was released for, namely the first, and unfortunately the only addition for the game Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty. It is not yet known exactly what will await us in it, but the main feature of this addition will be a “linear detective series.” Phantom Liberty takes place before the end of the original game in Dogtown, a previously inaccessible area of ​​Night City. Over this quarter, where bandits of various stripes live, the shuttle of the President of the New United States of America was recently shot down. Now the head of state is threatened by Kurt Hansen, the leader of Dogtown and a former arms dealer who has his own army under his command. V has to go to a new area, contact an undercover agent named Solomon Reed (whose role and face was given by Idris Elba) and save the president.                               Русс:  Спустя три года после релиза игры, я готов сделать обзор. За что  никогда нельзя было упрекнуть студию CD Projekt Red,  так это идти на «Осознанный риск», и Cyberpunk 2077  не стало исключением из данного правила. Сегодня 22 сентября 2023 года, и я готов с чистой совестью заявить: «Игра вышла в релиз», да я знаю, что релиз игры состаялся в декабре 2020 года, однако то что мы имеем сейчас в выходом 2.0 и версией от декабря 2020 - это небо и земля. Все механики, которые раньше не работали, и вызывали лишь отвращение и желание забросить игру, в патче 2.0, наконец-то, были исправлены. Теперь полиция - это полиция, а не появившиеся неоткуда ряженые клоуны. Главный герой теперь имеет руки и ноги во время подъема по лестнице. НПС научились адекватно реагировать на выстрелы (боевая система стала намного приятней, чем было раньше). Полностью было переработано древо навыков (менять их комбинации можно только один раз - учтите). Кроме того, теперь взаимодействие с второстепенными персонажами стали намного приятней, теперь хотя бы чувствуется, какой-никакой RPG отыгрыш. Вообщем все что должно было быть исправлено - исправлено. Таким образом, если вас оттолкнула данная игра на моменте релиза в 2020 году, можете смело ее брать - не пожалеете. Однако учтите, что системные требования, вместе с детализацией и новыми фишками, во много раз возросли. И в заключение, стоит сказать про то, ради чего выпускался патч 2.0, а именно про первое, и к сожалению единственное дополнения для игры -Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty. Пока точно неизвестно, что нас будет в нем ждать, однако основной фишкой данного дополнения будет «линейный детектив-сериал». События Phantom Liberty происходят до финала оригинальной игры в Догтауне — ранее недоступном районе Найт-Сити. Над этим кварталом, где обитают бандиты разных мастей, недавно сбили шаттл президента Новых Соединённых Штатов Америки. Теперь главе государства угрожает Курт Хансен — лидер Догтауна и бывший торговец оружием, у которого в подчинении находится собственная армия. Ви предстоит отправиться в новый район, связаться с агентом под прикрытием по имени Соломон Рид (роль и лицо которому подарил Идрис Эльба) и спасти президента.",

MUCH of the game is uninspired and phoned-in, like 95% of open-world games are. There is a lot of illusions of size and depth, but that's all most of it is, illusions. See all those buildings? 99% of them cannot be entered and are just empty squares and rectangles. The streets are often barren, even in the most populated areas you will see many identical twins when people are around. The interactions with npc are very limited, and in many cases just poorly made. It's not worth going into, just know it is a very soulless world, not even to it's benefit to show it being dystopian either.\n\nMANY if not MOST of the characters are unlikable, unbearable, cunts. Just, awful, annoying, terrible shitheads. There is almost no charm or nuance to ANY of them.\n\nGunplay is basic, but not bad. Melee is insanely boring, but still not bad. Hacking is boring, but not bad. That is kind of the whole game. It manages to just barely be better than average. I still recommend it, cause it just isn't bad... as long as you can look passed all of the glitches. Even after the 2.0 update, it is rough. In hindsight, they really should've just abandoned it and moved on as quickly as possible.",

I enjoyed this game from day 1, and did not have any of the performance issues that many players have, but I was a little critical of the pacing of the story and very critical of a lot of the combat mechanics. At the time my main thought was that the game as very very cool, but as it progressed the combat felt very stale, especially as enemies scaled to become bullet sponges and I felt that the various approaches to solving issues either landed on unsatisfying and frustrating gunfights or easy cheesy hacking that trivialized any challenges and left me feeling hollow. After update 2.0 I can safely say it feels like a different game entirely. I actually feel very engaged to swap between different combat styles depending on the scenario and all of them feel viable. I am currently doing a stealthy MGS style playthrough which I felt was completely impossible with the previous stealth mechanics. The new perks actually feel exciting once you get passed the initial tiers and the cyberware feels fleshed out (ironic) and lends itself more to roleplaying than just minmaxing numbers like before. I also think the loading screens are much faster than before which is great. I'm only a third of the way through the game on this new playthrough and this very positive experience has definitely encouraged me to get the DLC to try out the new story. I have not seen if the late game bossfights have improved at all but I am hopeful they end up being satisfying experiences.",

You can truly play the game how you want and the narrative will wrap itself towards your actions, leading to every playthrough being both mechanically and alternatively different if you want to see how deep the rabbit hole goes. [u]Yes, you can date the characters if you want a more Persona experience too, we won't judge you[/u]\n\n\n[h1] Combat & Diffuculty [/h1]\n\nThe combat is fast and intuitive, from the many many variations of common firearms to the unconventional iron to finally the quickhacking, being a beefed-up version of Watchdogs' exploding phones. There is a lot of variation to the moment-to-moment combat that the game gives you full reign to control proficiency in, be stealthy, loud, or a mix of the two. This control becomes very very broken at the end unless you are on a harder difficulty especially quickhacking, which turns the game into a point-and-click murdering simulator of people getting their brains fried, electrified, and set alight. [u]Though I still very much enjoyed this playstyle[/u]\n\n\n[h1] Verdict [/h1]\n\nIf you want a game to take you for a ride and immerse yourself into an action-packed, fresh open-world game where choices and decisions [b]will[/b] come back to bite you, I could not recommend a better narrative alongside the infinite possibilities of it's combat, [u]but[/u] be prepared to encounter many, many glitches that will challenge your very definition of how a glitch can ruin a game. \n[u]This game needed so much more time in the oven to come out crispy, tasty, and delectable but what we got is still nice and palatable cookiedough[/u]",

My son got this game for Christmas in 2022 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.",

We've got a city to burn.\nThis review comes from someone who had this game preordered months in advance, and had to deal with the nightmare which was launch, eventually refunding but decided to give it another chance to see if anything had changed\nto all others in my situation, or if your simply looking for something new to play, do not let launch cloud your judgement. \nPROS:\nVisually, Cyberpunk is a masterpiece! set in Night City, a place which truly never sleeps. at every corner you'll find something to do, or someone to kill. From Heywood to Pacifica, each district has its own charm, with gangs to match. Each of these gangs feel entirely different from eachother, utilising different types of weapons and cyberware which ensures you don't get bored just mowing down the same old npcs\n \nWhether it's skill trees or the choices you make in the story, each iteration of V feels unique enough to add some replay value once the main story is completed. Skill Trees blend first-person shooting, hacking, and stealth mechanics, providing players with a range of playstyles to suit their preferences.  e.g A \"Gun's Blazing\" build with the body and reflex skill tree feels entirely different than a \"Hack n Slash\" (pun intended) build with quickhacks and mantis blades \nAll of these however are just the icing on the cake ; One of Cyberpunk 2077's strongest aspects is its narrative. The main storyline, centered around V's journey through Night City, is captivating, filled with complex characters and thought-provoking themes. The branching paths and choices you make influence the outcome, making each playthrough feel unique. The side quests are equally engaging, often providing meaningful stories and memorable characters. \n\nPerformance issues which once plagued the game are now few and far between, thanks to continued updates and improvements from the developers, allowing for a smooth experience in this dystopian metropolis \nCONS: \nsome quests suffer from pacing issues, and certain storylines feel underdeveloped\nthe AI of both enemies and NPCs can sometimes be lacking, taking away from the games charm and immersion\nOVERALL/ TL:DR  :\nA real labour of love, Cyberpunk 2077 has slowly become the game it was meant to be. Once you decide to look past the horrors of launch, Night City will welcome you with open arms choom ^^",

                "review": "I've played the game for almost 60 hours and went through several different characters to finally settle for one and play for 30 hours straight in the last one.  To all those who're wondering what the state of the game is;\n\nThis game is undeniably flawed in many many ways. The cop/wanted system, the general A.I behavior, car driving, etc. are all too simple. As I played the game I made comparisons between GTA 5 and this game. Now some may say that wouldn't be a fair comparison but GTA 5 is a 10 year old game and it has done all these things better.( I've poured over 600 hours on GTA when it was still being updated on PS3 and then around 200 hours more on pc when Epic Games gave it for free. )\n\nI don't see the potential to pour that much time into Cyberpunk 2077 because the world simply feels too simple in terms of realism. Yes there are very cool dialogues and the npcs look way better but they lack any depth that GTA 5's NPCs had. The police system is a joke and you can simply get in your car and drive away for about a minute for the wanted status to go away. The cops also just randomly spawn behind you as I'm sure you've seen from videos on Youtube. Lastly, the vehicle driving was very boring for me and I simply did it to look around the gorgeous city the devs had made. The car acts like it was made out of some rubber material when I get into a collision and bounces off to somewhere else. The destruction for vehicles is also too simple. \n\nHowever, as you can see from above, I'm still recommending the game. \n\nThe reason for that is the highly enjoyable weapons system, the character skills, the beautiful graphics and the amazing city, a vast array of clothing to choose from (and the transmog system that they later on added), and well the really intriguing story, side missions and Panam. (lol) \n\nI love the companions in this game. I really enjoyed Keanu Reeves as Silverhand and characters like River and Panam (and let's never forget about Jackie) made the game much more enjoyable. The guns felt really good to use and I had a great time testing out different guns throughout my time with the game. The story was quite enjoyable and the side missions were also pretty good quality compared to other games in this industry. And well, the graphics and the city speak for themselves. \n\nWith all this in mind, I would say that this game is a flawed gem that was rushed by executives to save face in front of fans and investors for delaying it multiple times. While I do understand the anger some may still feel for how the game released, I would still urge you to try out this game because I think the developers have done a great job with how much time they had on their hands and just how ambitious the game was. \n\nI would give this game a 75/100 as I don't see myself replaying it now that I finished the story. And that is a generous verdict when we look at examples like No Man's Sky which added so much new content after the game released.\n\nLet's see if the 1.7 update does anything to improve on these things...",

Found only 1 Game breaking bug that doesn't let me finish a Side mission called \"blistering love\", rest of the bugs are... i would say are \"funny\" lol.\nKeeping aside the bugs...\nThe game is really Amazing, they have really shown a believable future city and an amazing story with great voice acting.\nGraphics look great and they are truly next gen as they have incorporated every upscaling methods, RTX, AI based Antialiasing, frame generation ... you name it ! this game is like a Tech Demo and a testing ground for all new graphic technologies.  \nRemember how movies purposely take away the guns from actors to show off hand fighting skills and muscles or create a situation that a nice looking actress has to take off most of her clothes to show off her body? this game does exactly that throughout, showing off RTX effects by purposely making every surface metallic or wet or shiny XD. \nI did not like the gunplay though. i completed the game on Hard difficulty and it felt very inconsistent, accuracy of the guns are random, sometimes you can get 1 shot from a very low level enemy. enemies sometimes become bullet sponges whereas some hard bosses die very quickly.\n\nOverall Definitely fun, worth buying and worth spending a lot of time.",

There's still some bugs here and there but I don't see them as something that would keep me from playing the game. There is just so much to do in the game. There are so many side missions and NCPD missions to do. The characters are amazing and I love games like this that can make you connect with characters. The graphics are amazing especially after adding FSR 2.1(or was it 2.2 I forget) and it still looked good on my 1080. The story is pretty great and prepare to bring a tissue or two for the end of the game. Overall an 11/10. A must buy if you love FPS games with a good story",

I look forward to playing it everyday, thinking about what I'm going to do and what missions i'm gonna complete. My two main complaints are these.\n\n- I feel like Jackie's story line is shockingly little, after I found out that the cut montage you get around the first 30 minutes of the game or so are all missions that were cut by CDP. That really disappointed me as his death felt way too early and almost made him look like a side character with no story, even though he's literally your best friend that your character constantly mourns every now and then. Maybe a DLC in the future that focuses on your friendship and fills the rest of the missions that never made the cut, for some reason.\n\n- The next complaint is the romance characters and how they just feel like another mission story. Although that's what they were, I wish after you romanced them that you could do more with them. For example, call them and be able to have them join you on missions, maybe more montages of you guys doing things, similar to the Jackie montage we get in the beginning of the game. Overall though, these characters are all really cool and enjoyable to play with.\n\nOverall, this game is amazing and is a 99% recommend. Can't wait for the DLC to drop.\n\n\n",

                "review": "I remember it was the end of 2020, I had a shitty job and was pretty bored with the games I had available at the time. I knew little to nothing about Cyberpunk or the hype that it has created prior to its release, so when I bought the game on their platform, wishful to experience something good, new and fresh, I really went in without any 'grand' expectations.\n\nWell, a month later and I had 130 hours in the game, and although there were bugs, stutters, lags and what else playing on my entry level rig, I still was enjoying the game, the world, the gameplay, the story, but most importantly the vibe.\n\nI will never forget early in the game, getting in the car with Jackie after the Sandra gig and chilling in the passenger seat as Jackie drove you back home while...\n\n[i][b]... City of dreams\nCity of gang, gang, gang, gang, gang\nCity of dreams\nLive in your grave\nYou live in your grave\nCity of dreams\nCity of gang ...[/b][/i]\n\n... would play in the background (if you know you know 😌).\n\nThat while you'd marvel at the futuristic setting of Night City from the 'comfort' of your car, witnessing the good and bad of a world gone hell-bent on consumerism, brutalism, capitalism, and expansionism, disregarding public safety and exploiting whatever member of society it could, a glimpse of a possible reality awaiting us in the future if we're willing to let it go there.\n\nStill, halfway through the game some story related bugs got to me, so eventually I've put the game down and decided to await the fixes and improvements promised by the dev.\n\nAbout a year or so later I grabbed Cyberpunk on Steam with a neat 50% discount to finally complete the game this time and get all of its achievements.\n\nAfter sinking in another 100+ hours here, completing the entirety of this game and seeing all the endings, all I can say is that I only ended up appreciating the game more, and the near dystopian world CD Projekt was able to present us with.\n\nThere are quests and questlines that arise some truly interesting questions, and with the rise of AI in our own world, these questions only gain more validity and will once become essential to consider and properly answer.\n\nAnd while the endings are all good in their own right, one or two of them really makes you think about what it means to be human, to be conscious, to know something, to be unsure if something's a distant memory or still a brain worm, to deal with an internal conflict you feel no resolve can be found for.\n\nAll in all, a great game, the closest you can get in terms of cyberpunk Skyrim with a deeper story. Sadly my score won't be higher since the over promises and buggy launch are aspects that cannot be so simply excused.\n\n[h1]Score - 8/10[/h1]\n\n[spoiler][i]...city o' gay...you live in Ukraine...[/i][spoiler]😛 (misheard lyrics btw)[/spoiler][/spoiler]",

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).\n2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.\n3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.\n4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.\n5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.\n6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing",

                "review": "I heard about the issues and criticism for this game, all of the backlash and disappointment about the final product back in 2020. To be honest, I really didn't cared about it much, I wanted to see how the game is now... and I have to tell you, that I'm flattered.\n\nFirst of all, the game has issues, like when the script sometimes doesn't go forward in certain situations, or the physics is weird most of the times, NPCs and vehicles doing silly things and appearing from thin air, a few times interacting is pain and of course, the driving is abysmal in the game, however you can get through all of them, find some kind of easy fix and you can also get use to the driving, too. It's not perfect indeed, but on the other side it has a great story, lot of interesting side missions and gigs, game mechanics which makes the gameplay more complex, the graphics looks amazing even in lower quality, and the soundtrack is fantastic. It's worth to explore Night City and not just focus on the main story missions, because you can miss a lot. \n\nMaybe the game deserved those criticism back then, I don't know really and don't care either, but playing it now is really great and I can't wait to see Edgerunners, because of it. There is no question that you should buy this one, even for the full price.",

Now nearly two years after it came out I've finished up with it and... it was worth it. Similarly to CDPR's last major game Witcher 3, this is easily one of the best open world RPG's i've played. The main story is plenty interesting enough, but all the side content - even tiny quick missions that in most games only fill the space - really help flesh out the world. The consensus? Night City is f*cked up and a pretty ugly place to live... but a great setting for a game. \n\nI did still have a few crashes, but my PC by now is seriously aging so maybe you won't have the same problems... maybe. At least the game autosaves often enough that the crashes didn't affect things much. Compared to how broken people made this game out to be at launch? It was perfectly acceptable.\n\nAnyway... I'm keeping this review short because I don't wish to spoil anything. This is the sort of game you really ought to experience for yourself. It is worth it. :D",

It definitely has! It's mostly stable, has a lot of content, and does a good job of mechanically representing the various kinds of cyberpunk one can be. \n\nHowever, it suffers from the not-too-uncommon problem of RPGs becoming movie-games. You can't really play a role, instead you are mostly a talking camera that follows the plot. You have very little influence on what happens and how, your reactions to events, even a lot of your personality. \n\nI think there's a place for movie-like games, where you fight and then sit back while the plot happens at you, God of War being a prime example, but in RPGs it's just frustrating because I'm given choices in some places and not others. You spent a lot of time stuck while long scenes of dialogue play out with no real influence, following people at a walking pace, picking a number of information options and then yes or no, and then going back to gameplay. The Lifepath does nothing, and you have no real opportunity to make a character your own. As a story, it's fine I guess, but I wish they just made the entire Johnny Silverhands subplot an anime like they did with Edgerunners, and instead crafted a story where you direct what happens rather than the developers.\n\nHowever, the gameplay is just sick. Running around doing random jobs is actually the best part of this game, ignoring the story for just being a person in Night City fighting to survive. I played as a netrunning ninja and as a gunslinging pistol user and both were incredible experiences. There's lots of verticality in the open world, interesting building layouts to sneak around in, and fairly competent AI to fight or sneak around. \n\nIf they took the mechanics and worldspace of this game and crafted an interesting, dynamic, branching story that made the game worth playing and replaying, this game could be great. As it stands, it's a fun cyborg criminal sim which wastes that world on a story you can't really influence.\n\nIf you're reading this before 3/23 or it's on sale again for 50% in the future, go for it! It's not devoid of fun by any means. However, at full price you could buy other games which have more emotional impact and replayability.",

I just...expected more. Night city's a dystopian LA/San Francisco, right? The game tells you to go big or go home. So do we get to see the big big city in contrast to the small small people like in the second opening of GTA V? No. Close your eyes to some minor details on cars you can pretend this is just the everyday world today.\n\nDo we see the artificial loneliness like in Bladerunner? No. Do we see the implications of new techs like Brain Dance? Like in Ghost in the Shell? Duex Ex? No.\n\nThere are factions, corpos and gangs and more, do we see their ideologies? When is the status quo and the stability worth preserving? When is the violent rejection the only choice? Do we get to see the flaws of all factions and choices like New Vegas? No. Do we hear reasonable arguments from all sides like in Disco Elysium? Do we get to see decay after economic blooms, see every ideology struggling to find a way out and people seeking bounds in a doomed world? No. \n\nJohnny Silverhand's in your brain, so do we discuss what's humanity what's real consciousness? Is Johnny real? Or anyone like him? Do we get our Westworld? Do we discuss player agency when there's literally another man inside the playable character's head controlling him time to time? Do we get some Bioshock? \n\nNo, Johnny doesn't care and neither should you.\n\nMost of these points are at best given a short quest to shine and at worst completely forgotten. Where's the Bloody Baron of this game? Prince Stannis? Where's Abigail?\n\nThe Witcher world is so vivid, so real, so strange, so esoteric yet so grounded. There are magic, unicorns, castles in the cloud, yet you can relate to the people inside. CDPR did a great job translating the books into games. You see the pain and sorrow of different characters. \n\nThe Cyberpunk world is static, detached, from your actions in gameplay. and your choices in story. It does not even show you the cold, uncaring face. It does not respond. It's boring. I have no knowledge of how good the source materials are but I truly expected better. This truly is the Mass Effect: Andromeda of CDPR, with improved gameplay and aggressively, aggressively mediocre story. I do not play your games for the gameplay, CDPR, I pay you to make me feel something, anything.\n\nDo better with the second title, please.",

                "review": "Cyberpunk 2077 is a beautiful game with a with many praise worthy highlights. Persistent bugs and the absence of basic functional game-play mechanics, however,  ultimately break immersion and cause the game to fall short of what it is trying to sell.\n\nI pre-ordered this game but abandoned it shortly after release because of its now legendarily poor state at launch. I didn't refund because I figured I'd eventually like to play it once the studio addressed some of it's critical issues. Now, in the second half of 2023, we're approaching 3 years since the game released. The studio has provided a large catalog of free updates and patches to fix the game and they are trying to sell us the first paid DLC for $30 USD. This all intrigued me enough to finally start a fresh play through of the game. I've now played around 70 hours of the \"new and improved\" Cyberpunk 2077. While the city is beautiful and there is fun to be had, the experience has sadly built up to the same familiar disappointments as before. \n\nA surprising number bugs have survived the parade of patches and updates that have released. Several times I found myself consulting the player community to try and find a workaround for a well-known bug relating to mission progress or an item. These don't always work and it can really cripple the sense of immersion or reward for the player. The game is too old for this kind of thing to be excusable. \n\nAs far as the game play itself, it's surprisingly bland and rail-esque. Despite the beautifully vibrant visual tapestry, the world is littered with wasted potential and what seems like abandoned ideas around every corner. Everything from the dialogue options to the mundane NPC interactions feels completely deterministic and arbitrary. Despite being set in a dense urban environment, there are no real systems in place for crime or police responses or gang factions or varied pedestrian reactions. Aside from a handful of missions that include it to some extent (often to the point of tedium), driving is a bland and ultimately meaningless mechanic that doesn't involve combat or even realistic physics. The story and script are contrived and melodramatic. Despite some occasionally intriguing concepts and satisfying moments, your intelligence is insulted at every point in the story by dialogue options that imply choice where truly none exist. Features like your character's chosen background or stats like \"street cred\" flaunt themselves as relevant but very quickly prove to be meaningless to your experience of the game whatsoever. All quests and side quests are represented as static points of interest on the map and they are progressed through, item by item, as one would with a lengthy to-do list. They all essentially have the same resolutions and quickly become redundant. Loot is very repetitive and inventory management is tedious. The shooting mechanics are unrefined and enemy AI is awkward. Hacking is surprisingly underwhelming and affects very few things in the game in rarely interesting ways. \n\nIt's obvious that this game takes inspiration from a lot of familiar sources. It feels like a Frankenstein project made of parts of GTA, Mass Effect, Deus Ex, Farcry, Elder Scrolls, etc . . . the problem is that the seams start to show very quickly. If you're into stealth games, the stealth isn't finished. If you're into driving games, the driving game isn't finished. If your into character building, the RPG isn't finished. If you're into the shooters, the shooting isn't finished. You get the point. This game sadly wasn't and isn't worthy of its \"next gen\" marketing identity. It tried and failed to do things that titles 3 generations ago did remarkably. Now CDPR is asking another 30 dollars for an expansion which features BASIC GAMEPLAY mechanics like police responding to crime and vehicular combat. My understanding is that these are things that can be addressed to some extent with free mods. Why anyone would feel compelled to fork over another 30 bucks just for more abysmally contrived writing is beyond me. I will definitely be waiting for reviews and sales before considering liberty city.  In the meantime, this experience has made me want to reinstall GTA and Deus Ex.",

                "review": "The game has a really great story that keeps you on the edge of your seat.  Most main characters that the protagonist V meets are flawed but memorable people.  And the music is an absolute banger.\nThe update 2.0 has reshaped pretty much all of the skill tree which in some ways encourages build types that are powerful but not too OP.  This update did introduce scaling difficulty which will make the game more forgiving for the non-hardcore crowd.  However, skill progression is now kind of meaningless as the purpose of levelling up was to tackle challenges that you couldn't before.  That is kind of gone now.\n\nAll in all the game is pretty good now.  But you might ask, why am I not recommending it?  The answer is simple, by encouraging you to buy this game I would also be encouraging you to support and enable the incompetence that is CDPR.  Just recently, they introduced another patch that was 50GB in size which was aimed at fixing a whole heap of bugs that were introduced via update 2.0 and the Phantom Liberty DLC.  Bugs that should not of been there to begin with.  It would seem that we are experiencing deja vu.  Do people not remember the disastrous launch of this game?  Maybe after a few more patches, we'll finally get the game that we should have got DAY ONE.\n\nI am of the strong belief that if I spend money on a product, I expect it to be in 100% working condition.  It needs to be working now, not later, NOW!  And no, I have not had any problems with the game aside from a few crashes and gameplay gltiches that were more comical than annoying.  But I shouldn't have to wait hours for the game to update because of CDPR's ineptitude.  \n\nI wrote my complaints in the comments section of the recent patch and lo and behold my comment had mysteriously vanished.  This reminds me of the time when the game launched in a horrible state.  I went to the forums to encourage people to have higher standards and to not accept/ enable such incompetence from game developers.  My comment was removed and I was temporarily banned for \"ugly speech.\"  Apparently encouraging players to have standards and calling out a game company's ineptitude is considered \"ugly speech.\"  Let that sink in.\n\nWell this is the review section and as such, you won't be able to silence me here my dear moderators.  I hate to break it to you, but no one is above criticism; not you and not even your beloved CDPR.  I hope that you realise that your behaviour is disgraceful and it not only makes you look bad but it also reflects poorly on CDPR as well. \n\nFor a while I've put this review on hold in the hopes that CDPR would redeem themselves.  However, when I think that their incompetence couldn't possibly get any worse, they go ahead and surprise me.  I mean, the game was in development for a decade and it's been three years since release and they still haven't got it right.  Absolutely ridiculous.  And people rewarded this incompetence with the Labour of Love Steam Award.  It's no wonder why the game industry is down the toilet right now.\n\nCDPR may have a been a good company once upon a time, but it would seem that they have joined the greedy, dodgy and incompetent ranks with Bugthesda and EA.  The game industry is in a shockingly dismal state right now and if gamers want things to change than you need to stop rewarding incompetence.",

I read the rules and broke none of them. \n\nSo I bought the game on a nvidia 1060. It was playable but sluggish, so I decided to upgrade HDD to SSD and GTX1060 to GTX 3060. 16GB gaming RAM and I5 8400. Everyone tells me this should run the game fine, especially since the former almost ran it.\n\nWell, since upgrading to the new specs I got into game and was immediately met with the cannot sprint bug. Spent an hour or two trying to fix it and it eventually began to work. I can sprint again. I made it to the strip club for my first brain dance. 2 seconds into brain dance I crash, try again 2 more times, crash at same area. I then change graphics settings from ultra to low. Then it crashes after I try to leave menu. So on start up I crash. Restart PC and make it back in game. Next 2 times I hit select button it crashes game. I finally confirm I am on low settings, I go into GE experience and update my drivers. Last 5 crashes all came on the start up Project Red logo.\n\nThe next two things I wanted to try were turn off V-Sync and Ray tracing(if they are even on now that my settings are set to low). I am 14 hours into the game and spent almost all of it trying to fix this nonsense. Checked many forums already and give up. PLEASE HELP. I really want to play.\n\nI remember always thinking I am so smart for not buying games until they've been out a while and I know I wont get a buggy mess. This is silly.\n\nI am 20 crashes deep now. Drivers updated. I have verified game file integrity. Updated drivers. Tried launching from GeFOrce and Steam. Restart computer after changes. What else can I do??\n\nGame is an unplayable mess.",

All of these have been free downloads and the game is amazing; it even has full VR compatibility.\n\nIt's been three years now since Cyberpunk launched and it's still not where it should be. All updates over the first year were things that should have been sorted out even before a potential Early Access version. CDPR skipped everything, crunched for launch, gave the worst version of a AAA game we've ever seen, threw basic bug fixes at it over the years as if they were doing something worthwhile, and now they want to charge $40 for some DLC on a still unfinished game. Fuck CDPR and everything they're doing with Cyberpunk. The game is a far cry from their promise and they created a defining moment in gaming history of how obvious AAA game developers are doing it for the money. Yes I'm still pissed about this game. They fucked up and continue to handle it poorly and they don't deserve more money for DLC that should be free.",

At this point, it is quite literally unplayable as it crashes before the opening screen even comes up for me. I've been reading for other folks that the game might start, but will crash at random intervals after a short time playing.   \nI don't use any mods and play completely vanilla, so that's not the issue. From what I've been seeing online, many others who are playing vanilla are also experiencing crash issues. Projekt Red has yet to even address the issue",

The stories, the atmosphere and the characters have all been captivating for me.\n\nSo, why the downvote?\n\nBecause this is the second large update that has completely broken the game for me, resulting in a crash on launch, and for what? so the 1% with the highest graphics cards can see one more pixel? Managed to fix the first time but haven't the faintest how to fix it again. shame, was really looking forward to the next expansion.\n\nEdit: This has been patched with the most recent hotfix, however my point remains that both updates broke the game. The game is working but I am just waiting for the next big update that breaks the game.",

The only thing that can be done is to improve the STATS, and in a few variety of weapons, the colors change, and nothing more.\n\n\nThe cars were a mess handling, you can buy cars, but they can't be modified as promised.\n\nThere are parts of the map that were never finished, not to mention the metro system that was promised, it shows that something happened in the development of the game, a pity.\n\nTheme of secondary missions are entertaining more than the main story.\n\nVery repetitive activities.\n\nThey honestly promised something they didn't deliver. A real shame because the base is there, I hope they fix it or improve it, but I doubt it.\n\nIf there was a scoring system I would give it a 6. but since it does not exist it is negative but the CDP lies and the promises that they did not keep.\n\n\n\n.\n",

The only time it feels like im actually talking to a person is when interacting with Johnny, one of my fav parts of this game.\n[b]2.[/b] Skill trees are absolutely pathetic, nearly all perks are just meager stat bonuses. Borderlands 2 did skill trees much much better [i]11 fucking years[/i] ago. Not to mention crafting is mostly locked behind one skill tree. meaning if you dont wanna spec into technical you wont be able to craft anything above uncommon items. too bad!\n[b]3.[/b] While the gunplay is enjoyable and the same goes for melee combat, the weapon pool is so small. For example there are only 2 lmgs, both are power and none are iconic, while pistols have tons of iconics to choose from.\n\nand you know what, even with all this i'd be willing to give this game a recommended\nIF the game didnt run like shit\nand didnt have copious amounts of INFURIATING unfixed bugs\nCyberpunk has the worst popin ive ever seen in any game EVER\nthe time it takes for textures to properly load is unacceptable\nThis is the first and last game im buying from cd project.",

I've not yet seen a solution which doesn't have at least one user reporting it doesn't work so you might be unable to play indefinitely, however these things have all worked for at least one user:\n\n1) Launching from the exe directly rather than through steam (Find it in your steam/steamapps/common/cyberpunk2077/bin/ If you can't remember where you installed steam you can also find it by right clicking on it in your library, selecting properties and then \"browse\" under local files)\n\n2) Find that exe, but rather than launching it, right click and select properties. Toggle \"run as administrator\" (I have seen both \"turn it off if it's on\" and \"turn it on if it's off\" reported as successful solutions)\n\n3) Go to your graphics card manufacturers webpage and manually download the latest drivers (Windows automatic update will tell you that you have the latest driver when you do not, check the version number against the manufacturer's latest offering)\n\n4) Verify game files (Okay, I've not actually heard anyone say this has worked for them, but always try it before doing a full reinstall. It's quick and some day it'll work!)\n\n5) Uninstall, delete all relevant files and reinstall. The files are (From a comment CrimsonRider made on another thread):\n\nCyberpunk 2077 folder from here: ...\\steamapps\\common\\Cyberpunk 2077\nCyberpunk 2077 folder from here: %userprofile%\\Saved Games\\CD Projekt Red\\\nREDEngine folder from here: %userprofile%\\AppData\\Local\\\nCD Projekt Red folder from here: %userprofile%\\AppData\\Local\nCD Projekt RED folder from here: %userprofile%\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\n\nIf you're not using cloud saves you need to back up your save files or you'll lose all of your progress.\n\nIf you have mods you have a more complicated time, but anyone who can install a mod should be able to figure out how to remove them properly.\n\nUnfortunately the game is 100% unplayable to some portion of the userbase, even unmodded, even trying every fix. Obviously that makes buying it a bit of a gamble, which is a shame, because it really is quite good.",

                "review": "I feel like even with the updates and quality of life improvements, this game feels lacking in many ways.\nWhile the game looks really good and has great presentation, the world beyond that feels pretty shallow, yes it looks very pretty and believable, but thats it, there is very little interaction with many elements of the world (not even a cab system, or trains). I also think at a certain moment gameplay starts to feel stale. I played with many builds, one example is a melee build. It was cool at first, but it got very samey quickly, When I did get mantis blades that changed it up a bit, but it didn't progress much after that besides other cyberware. Most perks tend to just add bonuses to different stats in combat aswell. One aspect where this game shines however are the characters especially in the main story, but these stories tend to play out quite linearly, which means the player doesn't have much agency (accept for the first act). The lifepaths don't influence much besides the beginning mission and a few extra dialog options. Compare this to clans vampire the masquerade bloodlines, or backstory options in mass effect, these can open up whole new quests and player homes (in bloodlines) and at least give more in game dialogue relating and expanding on these backgrounds (such as mass effect). Ultimately, I feel this game fails at being a good rpg (because of its lack of choice), fails at being a good shooter (gunplay feels good, but gets samey quick), fails at being a good open world game (because other than looking pretty, you don't actually interact much with the city in a way that feels truly immersive besides really surface level stuff). I really wanted to like this game, but I just can't. So many other games in these genres do it better (deus ex, VTMB, etc). I just wish there was a game that has the stunning visuals and general presentation and atmosphere that 2077 delivers, but with more actual substance.",
